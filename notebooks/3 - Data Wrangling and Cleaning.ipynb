If we have to ignore the negative on the outside, we are more likely to dwell on them on the inside .SO, here it is, what if we honored all of our feelings. Shared the good and the bad, made note of everything we are feeling, and then just let it come and go as the feelings should. We are meant to have them all we are meant to FEEL because that is what life is. We are human.

You may say he does not put the toilet seat down .I always do..that is not a reflection of me , so before we get lost in that, try to understand the hurt, wound, or meaning taken from the complaint. Maybe you do not feel important, or listened to? Maybe you feel like he does not care? Maybe you feel like you do not have a voice? Connect to the hurt instead of the complaint. Once you do that, then ask yourself how well you show up in that area. Do you make your partner feel important, heard, and like he has a voice? I bet there is room for growth there. So slow down, and gain awareness and understanding of yourself and your reactions. How you respond says a whole lot more about your emotional understanding of yourself and your partner. When you can start to do this together, you will be heading for something absolutely amazing.'},\n",

So if you are ready to arrive see below : Understand your fear. You need to deconstruct that thing to its bones. You need to understand the meaning around it. Why do you fear it? Is it what others will think about you? What society says? What message is attached to the fear? Should you feel shame or embarrassment? When we choose the fear, we wind up trying to save our ego. We wind up saying it is too uncomfortable for me to let other people see me this way, so I choose what is safe. That is NOT stepping into your greatness. That is NOT choosing the bigger picture.

We question why we have not met the one or why we did not land the job? We often try so hard to rush the process because we are attached to an outcome instead of slowing down to gain the wisdom and growth that are a part of the journey. Someone tells us they need time time to figure themselves out, and two weeks later we wonder why they do not have all of the answers. Remember to be patient with yourself and patient with others. This is different than just waiting. You do not need to put your life on hold, but you do need to remind yourself to be patient To not allow your expectations and need to be in control of the process get in the way of allowing the growth to happen naturally. Patience is a beautiful thing when you navigate it properly. It is not just that good things come to those who wait. It is that good things come to those who learn and grow while they wait.'},\n",

As we learn ourselves and step into our our own understanding, we get closer and closer to that dream and recognizing what is actually most important. You see, the dream of another begins to show up when you realize you have always just been dreaming about you as your greatest self. Because when we step into that space we attract that back. What we have always fantasized and dreamt about is a reflection of what we actually want in ourselves. So step into that dream for you grow yourself to be the greatest version of you and your fantasy of another will show up in far greater ways than you have ever imagined.'},\n",

You cannot neglect each other during the week and then show up for a date night every once in awhile and expect to have a deep connection. Couples need bids for connection every day. Research shows how important it is to be incorporated into your partner is life. This does not mean that you have to do everything together, but it does mean that you are asking each other about your day, maybe eating dinner together at night, cozying up on the sofa for your favorite show, or just chatting about something you heard on the news. It does not matter what your bid is it just matters that you are actively participating in your relationship each day. That you are showing up. Bids are the active ingredients in a relationship, and they are the reminder that my partner is interested in my life my partner cares . It is so important to have that reminder every day. Do not just show up for a date night once in awhile show up for your relationship all of the time.'},\n",

Because the truth is, if someone is questioning us, it means they are questioning themselves and a person who questions themselves is not capable of full love. They are not ready for the type of the love that asks them to show up. Anyone who is not certain in their partner is not certain with themselves. So if a person is struggling between you and someone else, let them go and send the message that you are choosing yourself. If they can not , you will. So here is two things I want you to do 1. Follow if you do not already because he is one of the most inspirational men I know that lives a life that he preaches, and 2.

Something uttered at the end of relationships at a rate of 100 I am sort of kidding but I bet that we have at least said that once or twice in our lives. So a couple of things. When we are at the end of a relationship we are generally emotionally flooded. That means the feelings are cray. Bouncing all over. We may have moments of clarity, anger, sadness, avoidance, despair, on and on. Our narrative of never finding the right person can get triggered on top of everyone always leaves me , I am going to be single forever , I am not good enough for anyone. First, all of those are crap. You are your second enemy your first is anyone who ever sent you that message to begin with. But guess what they are not responsible for your thoughts, so it is up to you to tell your mind to lovingly and start replacing it with something positive and strength based. The second piece here is maybe even more important and helpful. There are parts of a person we might always love. There are people who come into our lives and show us a different type of love. They are the crease in our story, and it is why we so often say that we will never find someone quite like that person .well, because we never have before, and it is taken so long to find him or her. But what we need to understand is that our love story is one that does take and search for the greatest parts of all of our past partners, and then search for those parts again in everyone we meet. But it does not end there because that is where we ask more of the next. We ask them to be ready to show up. Because no matter how wonderful or incredible the last was they were not enough not for you. So do not be afraid of looking for all those amazing parts in people how wonderful to have had a relationship that has imprinted on you in such a way that you look for so many parts of it again.

Old friendships that grow with you are the greatest , but maybe it is time to shift ourselves into a space of opening up to new people stepping into a vulnerable space, and allowing connection.

Say you decide to go out after work to meet up with some friends instead of going home and spending time with your partner. You call to let your partner know, they kind of tell you that they would prefer you to come home, but you decide it should not be such a big deal to go grab one so you will be home in a couple of hours.

Ever find yourself question if your partner loves you ever hear them say but I do!! I show you all the time! .and there you sit, like really?! I do not see it. I do not feel it.

That means, if we feel loved the most by spending quality time with someone, we are going to show our love to someone else by you guessed it spending quality time with them. Sounds great, right?

So often we are resistant to change although I believe in it, encourage it, and challenge it , but truth is, our change is actually us just finding ourselves finding our truth. The resistance we have to change no longer needs to be there when we realize that it is actually just us stepping into our truest selves. From birth we are given verbal and non verbal messages about gender, culture, religion, relationships, education, etc etc etc. We subscribe to narratives that have been given to us before we are able to form our own. Often, ones we have been given are truly aligned with us, but sometimes we find that they are not. Sometimes we find ourselves living in a story that is not our truth we tell ourselves things that we do not actually believe, do not want to believe, or simply just do not serve us.

The purpose is not to compare who has had it worse, but rather to recognize that no matter how bad or how good we have had it, we are a part of human systems and because of that, we are let down, disappointed, and hurt along the way We all have wounds. That is nothing to be ashamed of in fact, we will do much better once we can embrace them and identify what they actually are When we do not understand, we seek partners who will recreate the same patterns we have experienced before. It is why we so often find ourselves comparing partners to parents. It is our subconscious that is attracted to the injury i know, i know hang in there because we want so badly to know from the people we love that the injury is not true Maybe we had a father who never made us feel important, who made us question whether we mattered more than his business trips, or his drinking, or his gambling and then we find ourselves choosing partners who make us question the same thing our worth. It does not have to be the same content it is just that we are left with our wound reopened, our hurt deepening, and us questioning do I even matter? When we walk into relationships blindly, we will walk into reopening our wounds over and over and over again.

But when we use it to keep our thoughts, feelings, or truths from our partners, family, and close friends, silence becomes a betrayal of ourselves and our responsibility to those relationships. We can be so afraid of sharing our feelings with others. We stay quiet instead of expressing our concerns, wants, and emotional needs. We convince ourselves that we should not need that , or we are not deserving of it maybe the other person should just know . Maybe we just do not want to complain, or maybe it is not what a real man does . Maybe we are supposed to be the pleaser, or we are afraid of people getting upset with us or maybe it is just too soon in a new relationship to ask or need something. The list goes on and on, but at the end of the day, too often, our silence is not beautiful it is detrimental. It is our responsibility to ourselves to honor our thoughts, feelings, and needs. Silence is rarely just silence most of the time, silence is occupied by our inner chatter an internal battle with ourselves. When the messages we say to ourselves impact us and the relationships around us, when they impact our happiness, and keep us from living our greatest lives, it is our responsibility to share it. It is important. You are important. And your relationships can only grow and develop when you trust yourself and each other to communicate what matters. People desperately want to hear what is going on inside. The right people will listen and when you trust that you are enough, your silence will get heard.'},\n",

Understand their family system, and what role they played in it. What messages did they receive growing up? What were they told about themselves?

We want the promise of forever, yet we create prisons for ourselves and others and then wonder why it is we or they try to escape the relationship. Love should not be a prison but so often that is exactly what it turns into. What controls us and contains us is exactly what it is we so often try to flee from. If the walls are coming in, we will use every ounce of energy to push them out. The greatest love gives freedom. Freedom to be ourselves, freedom to choose, freedom to heal, freedom to express ourselves and be heard, freedom to ask for and get our needs met When we enter into a relationship our hope is that our partner is not going to recreate the hurt and injuries that we have experienced before. We enter in with an expectation to be free of that pain and then right there right there in our relationship we start to feel everything we have tried to escape our entire lives : unheard, lonely, unimportant, abandoned, isolated, disregarded etc. If we are not doing our part as a partner to create safety in the relationship i.e. we do not make our partner feel heard, important, listened to, appreciated, WHATEVER their injuries call for they will likely feel trapped and want to escape. Problem is we do not know how to always identify and communicate our hurt. So escaping prison does not mean honoring ourselves and communicating our hurt and needs appropriately. It shows up as divorce, cheating, escaping to alcohol, drugs, gambling, shopping, food it shows up as shutting down, sharing less, and pulling away. Do not be a prisoner to yourself. You must have the courage to share your hurt and ask for what you need and as a partner you must be attuned to what messages you are sending to your partner. Do they feel free? Or are they trapped in injuries? Now might be the time to ask before one or both of you wants to escape. Inspiration from the lovely'},\n",

We like knowing that if we do 'X', 'Y' will happen. We want certainty, and we want to know that if we work hard, practice more, stay up longer, put in the hours, read up, and apply we will have success. Sounds lovely yet somehow that does not always apply to relationships. We can give all of ourselves and do everything right , and it still will not be our choice if someone stays or goes. We can beg, plead, promise, change, be better, more attuned, and still still it is not all our choice. There is ALWAYS someone else that is choosing with us for us grrr when we are in a relationship. That is why love can be so scary; there is no certainty. Hollllldddd on . but we took vows! yes, you did. You promised to stay together NO MATTER WHAT. Whether you subscribe to that or not, what is not spoken in that space is a vow to remain happy forever a vow that we will not emotionally leave one another. Yes, you may not divorce or exit the relationship by actually physically leaving, but you may leave emotionally. Promising happiness forever or to emotionally be engaged at all times is not possible. We can not promise that because we are human. Period. So instead of looking to control outcomes and demand promises from others demand it from yourself. You are only in control of yourself and sometimes that is even a stretch . Promise what you know you can give and then talk about the rest. Focus on being the best partner. Focus on nurturing your happiness. Focus on strengthening the Self, and maintaining your roles and identity. Love yourself. Honor yourself. Honor your partner. Show up in the best way you can and then do better tomorrow. You will encourage the same in your partner you will attract that back and if you do not , you are still prepared to choose yourself even if someone else can not . Want to learn more?

Maybe narratives surface and remind us that nobody cares , you have to handle everything on your own , they will think I am awful if I talk about this the list goes on and on, and it is exactly what keeps us from having the conversations that matter. Guess what if it is in your head it matters. If you are struggling with it it is important. But YOU have to make it important. You have to choose that what you are feeling is more important than your fears more important than your negative narratives. You are not defined by them you are defined by what you allow. Think it is wrong to say it is often lonely being a stay at home mom ? It is not I can not tell you how many mothers share that exactly and follow it up with but I do not think any other mother feels that way I feel like an awful mom saying that. and so we do not except to your therapist but that is not enough. What about not feeling like a man . Are you supposed to do it all, and not speak about how you are feeling? Because that is what men do? Everything is supposed to always be okay , or I need to keep it together, or men are not supposed to talk about feelings. Guys .you are not alone. None of you are alone. But we do not know this because we do not talk about it. Everything is hush hush. We do not have conversations about the things that go against our narratives, and that is precisely what we need to be having conversations about.

With them there is always an opportunity for growth, personal understanding and development. They challenge us in new and old ways, and if we look closely enough, they shed light on exactly what it is we need to understand about ourselves. Sometimes good, sometimes bad but it is exactly what we need. Our past partners were exactly what we were ready for it at that point in our lives.

Most of the time when people are re-entering into our lives, it is not because of love it is not after all of this hard work, self discovery, or change it is because their ego is bruised they did not want to show up before for you, but now when you are leaving now when you can show up for someone else or someone else can show up better for you, they want back in. That, my friends, is called fear. When second chances are driven by fear you may have months of bliss and a honeymoon stage again but beware, because the same patterns, same issues, same dynamic will always reappear if the proper work has not been done.

We need to learn ourselves so that we stop hurting other people. We need to take our blinders off and have a deep relationship with ourselves so others are not loved incorrectly. One of my favorite quotes is: The biggest coward is a man who awakens a woman is love with no intention of loving her. This is true for men and women. Do not be a person who enters a relationship without the intention of loving them fully. Be deliberate with your love, otherwise continue to work on yourself until you can.

Let yourself feel. Cry. Hurt. Cry some more you are not human if you do not . It hurts because it mattered. Remember that, and be gentle with yourself 2. Talk about it. Share it with friends, family your therapist Talk it through over and over again. Say it to yourself. Recognize how you feel today. Maybe it is the same as yesterday..maybe it is a little different. But keep talking about it and sharing how you feel. Processing it is necessary. Sometimes we have to say the same things 13 times to really feel heard 3. Stay busy not avoidant. Do not just do things to fill your time. Do the things you love to do because YOU LOVE TO DO THEM. Keeping parts of your identity during this time is crucial. A big part of your identity just got wiped being a partner . so it is critical that your other roles are intact. You may not be a partner anymore, but you are still the rest of yourself. Do not let those parts go 4. Exercise. Every. Day. when you work out you are not just doing a great thing for your body, you are also cleaning your mind. When a relationship ends, we are generally pretty emotionally flooded that means the emotions can take over, often times leaving us feeling like we are drowning. When we work out, we release endorphins, serotonin, dopamine .it boosts our mood and decreases our pain. It helps us think about what is happened from a clearer space. We need that 5. Surround yourself with people who love you. you may not be feeling particularly lovable. That narrative gets questioned so being around people who remind you that you are loved and cared about is necessary As you begin to do these things, you begin to learn how to exist without that person.

Because alone has narratives attached to it that can make us feel embarrassed, ashamed, lonely and having someone makes us feel better about ourselves as if our worth is elevated because someone will be with us Loneliness often drives us into relationships that do not positively serve us. So often when we experience loneliness we look for the outside world to fill that space; we are convinced we need someone or something else. Our narrative tells us that we are not enough, and if only we had someone or something we would be okay Let loneliness be an indicator that you need yourself the most. Turn inwardly and remind yourself that you are enough. Look for things that are self satisfying and uplifting cook, workout, read, write, watch movies or your favorite shows, go for a walk, find something beautiful outside, sit and observe others, or yourself . The possibilities are endless you just need to find what is soothing for you. So, the next time you feel lonely, find a way to take care of yourself without the escape from yourself. You are enough, and once you begin to adopt that thought, you will be able to attract that from someone else. You will be able to choose someone instead of need them.

Sure, there is constantly space for us to communicate more effectively, to be direct with our needs and wants from our partners and friends but that is different than allowing a space for our heart to get re injured over and over and over again. To be injured in the first place is one thing, but then to abandon your own boundaries and self love is yet another self injury. You are enough. Your heart is enough. Create a space that keeps people and things that lift it up instead of tearing it down. And STOP justifying people and things that throw negativity towards it.

We try to control and mastermind a way to make it all go according to our plan. There is a difference between setting goals and being attached to an outcome. We should set goals. We should challenge ourselves and grow to be great in whatever it is we seek. But needing to control an outcome really does not work out in our favor. Too much of our self worth gets wrapped up in it. We need something to happen, otherwise we are not good enough, smart enough, loved enough . The things we can not control we need to work towards letting go .letting go of it going the way we want it to go. Just because we can not control love does not mean we give up on it. We work towards being a better partner, setting clear boundaries, we work towards self love and living our most authentic lives that is the way we show up. But if we just work towards controlling love it will not ever show up in its best form. TRY THIS Think about all of the things you can not control in your life right now. Make a list. What is on that list? Now think about what you have been doing to try to control it? What have you been forcing? Has it been working? In what ways? How not? Now think about letting go of that control. How does that feel? What does it look like in your life? What do you envision? Picture the most beautiful setting of you letting go and creating a space of total freedom instead of control. What is around you? Are you smiling? Can you breathe easily? Capture that. Let those things come towards you. Create a space for it to freely show up instead of controlling it to be there. Work on yourself, set goals, and create a space for freedom where you once controlled. See how life changes.'},\n",

I have found it incredibly helpful to switch my thinking around this. How deeply did I transform? How much growth do did I have with this person, has he challenged me and shed light on my blind spots? Has this relationship challenged and encouraged me to be better? The answers to these questions tell us how deeply we have been moved how deeply we have been transformed. So much of our own personal and relational success comes from our ability to see and embrace opportunity for transformation. So take a look. Have your relationships transformed you?

What we focus our attention on will occupy our minds and from there we can feel a ton of emotion that will tell us either negative or positive based thoughts about who we are, what we are doing, and where we are going. Makes sense, right? If we are gazing and focused on the negative, we are more likely to feel negative emotions, and if we see and focus on the positives, we are going to feel better about things. This we know, yet we often times find ourselves sliding into a space where we are occupied with more negatives than positives. This needs to change. Research shows that with couples we need a minimum of 5:1 positive to negative exchanges as a baseline for happy healthy relationships. Why would it be any different than our relationship with ourselves? If we are constantly thinking or focused on negative thoughts and we are not having at least 5 positive thoughts to negate the negative one, we are going to fall into a space where the lens through which we see life is negative. Focus on the positive. No need to avoid the negative feel it, give it a space to breathe, but then find the beauty around it. Find what is going right, and look to see how the negative is for you.

How can I forgive this person for wronging me in this way? We play with the idea of forgiving but not forgetting. Does it mean that what they did was okay? I am hurt so badly. Will I ever get over it? Should I? We ask these questions often without conclusion. There are answers but today I would like to shift our focus and talk about forgiving ourselves. Like others, we screw up. We let ourselves down. We say nasty things to ourselves, and can often be our own worst critic. Maybe we self harmed, maybe we watched as our sibling or parent got abused, maybe we did not stand up for our friend, or we have lived a selfish life where we have put ourselves first at the expense of others. Maybe we have been mean, and rude, and used drugs or alcohol or sex to cope with things. Maybe we have gambled away our savings, or abandoned a child a partner ourselves. We are human. We screw up sometimes badly. But forgiving ourselves is a must. More often than not, we are just as frustrated and hurt with ourselves than anyone else. Yet we avoid processing the anger and hurt that we carry around. Maybe we are angry with ourselves for letting our sister get hit we question why it was not us and then wish we could go back and protect her from it. Or, we have such disgust for ourselves after spending all of our savings and are ashamed and embarrassed that we can not buy our children the things they want. Before we do anything, we must give ourselves permission to forgive ourselves. It does not mean that what we have done is okay it just means that we accept that we are human and did not know how to handle that time any differently. We must be gentler with ourselves. Forgive for not knowing better, and then grow. Grow from that space. Commit to being better. Commit to handling things differently. Remind yourself that you are not re-entering that old space, but rather stepping into something new. You deserve forgiveness. You are human and you are imperfect.'},\n",

We finally put the excuses and fears aside, and prioritize our best self. We look inwardly and ask what it is we can create we identify what it is we want to celebrate over and over again each day. It is not that everything goes perfectly when we have found purpose it is just that we accept and know that we are exactly where we need to be and in that space, the challenges are fuel they inspire and we embrace. We do not fight it. We do not complain too often because our purpose is too clear too great. We really have to like ourselves to get anything done in this world. I posted that quote not too long ago. There is so much truth there. We need to really love our purpose. It is what will trickle down and impact every other part of our lives. It will change our relationships with others and with ourselves. Clear purpose creates a joy within us. It gives us a role it gives us an identity with which we are able to positively connect. Purpose is what our partners are able to desire in us most. Our desire for one another can be at its greatest when we see our person doing what it is they love and owning it. So if your purpose is not clear, search for it discover it now. It is never too late. Do not allow anything to get in your way. If nothing mattered except your joy, what would you be doing? Do that and then share it with the world.'},\n",

We may preach freedom, but most of the time we want people to do what we want them to do and then how we feel becomes dependent on whether we successfully control that or not. The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. We have come to believe the opposite. We have come to adopt messages like you complete me you are my other half and we are taught that being alone is lonely. We are sent messages that there is something wrong if someone is single . Why are you single? You seem like a great catch! We have it wrong. Being alone is not something to be ashamed of. Being alone successfully is something to be celebrated. It is deliberate time spent making that space great. Whether you are in a relationship or not, being alone is a critical component of our overall health. We need to spend time with ourselves and only ourselves often. We have to make our solitude beautiful because when we do, we can begin to love others without any need from them.

I think we are becoming more receptive to seeing our losses as gains We talk often about it creating space for something better, but let is expand on it a bit more. We lose great things because we have grown or the other person has . We lose great things because we have worked at it and have earned something more or they have . Losing great things is not a punishment it is either earned or a calling. We do not get greater things without working for them, but most of the time they come disguised. Most of the time they present as something painful. When things change in our lives, it is because we have either done the work to receive something greater or the other person has. It is more difficult when it is the other person because we are generally blinded by the change but that space can call us to our growth if we allow it and you guessed it, something greater comes too. We struggle the most when we choose to stay stuck. When our narratives allow us to ask why is this happening to me? Great things come when we do the work. Great things come when we choose to grow. Great things are all around us right now, but they will not be enough down the road. As we grow, the things and people around us need to as well. If you commit your life to growth, you will always be choosing a greater you, and you will demand more from yourself and others. Growth will be had and it will come to you as earned or as a calling.

It is worth the read. Here are his words: 3. Happiness is different than Joy I just want to be happy. I hear that all the time. But what IS happiness? Happiness is an emotional response to an outcome If I win I will be happy, if I do not I will not . An if-then , cause and effect, quid pro quo standard that we cannot sustain because we immediately raise it every time we attain it. You see, happiness demands a certain outcome, it is result reliant. If happiness is what you are after, then you are going to be let down frequently and be unhappy much of your time. Joy, though, is something else. It is not a choice, not a response to some result, it is a constant. Joy is the feeling we have from doing what we are fashioned to do, no matter the outcome. Personally, as an actor, I started enjoying my work and literally being happier when I stopped trying to make the daily labor a means to a certain end I need this film to be a box office success, I need my performance to be acknowledged, I need the respect of my peers. All reasonable aspirations but truth is, as soon as the WORK, the MAKING of the movie, the DOING of the deed became the reward in itself I got more box-office , more accolades and respect than I would ever had before.

It is so difficult for our mind to catch its breath. So what is closure really all about? And why do so many of us feel like we need it in order to move on? And what happens if we can not get full understanding and closure what if the other person refuses or can not explain? I think most of the time we are looking for a picture of clarity. One that will dispute a negative narrative that often points fingers and places blame. Most people do not love a bad ending. Clarity and certainty help paint a picture that is easier for us to move forward. We have taken care of the question marks and filled the gaps with something that makes sense even if we do not like it . But what about when we do not get closure from others? We do have all of the clarity and certainty we need it is just that we are often so flooded and confused that we can not reach it ourselves. It is why we often say I need you to explain it to me. You owe me that! Truth is, we already know. We know it is mediocre love, or that something was off. We know that the person did not bring out the best in us, or vice versa. But we begin to question our worth instead of finding certainty in the story and relationship that was just in front of us. This is undoubtedly a tough space to sit in but I want to encourage trusting yourself to have the answers. Yes, another person giving clarity about their part can be helpful, but most of the time all we actually need is ourselves our honest feelings an acceptance and reality of what was actually happening in the relationship, and an understanding that something greater is around the corner.'},\n",

Maybe we are supposed to be quiet maybe we were part of a family system that did not value our thoughts maybe no one ever asked maybe keeping the peace within an already chaotic family system meant staying quiet maybe men are not supposed to have emotions or as a woman you have been criticized for your emotions being too emotional needy crazy. The list can go on and on. It is important to understand what it is that actually keeps us from sharing what is really going on? Think about that. When you feel something, what do you say to yourself that stops you from sharing it. Identify that first. Now let is try to understand why? What is happened that is supported that fear? Maybe it is past experiences with that person? Maybe it is messages you received growing up from family society? You see, the problem with saying I am fine when we are actually feeling something else is that we send ourselves the message that we are not important enough to challenge the narrative that is keeping us quiet. It is like we have accepted the narratives as truth or we have accepted our role as one that we are stuck in for life. We stop fighting for it to be different. We begin to believe there is no use anyway. We are all important enough to challenge those narratives. We have the capacity to choose differently. We are capable of changing our role within relationships and voicing our feelings and having them be heard. But we must always believe that we are important enough and not a problem to be heard.

The most remarkable relational growth will always come when two people are working at it together. Invite your partner to show up invite yourself to show up. If either of you struggles with fighting for the relationship, ask yourself what is keeping you from doing it? What are you avoiding? What are your fears? Fight for your relationship every day. Ask your partner how you did today? Ask how you were as a partner? Learn and be open. Commit to growth every day. Commit to loving harder to showing up better. Commit to speaking their language, and commit to having yours understood. Speak and listen and fight. But just remember, you are more powerful as two.

When we question that, we generally act out in some way we still have a little kid in us . It is the unresolved part of us that acts out instead of putting words to our unmet emotional needs. So, we push the boundaries. We do not pick up a call or we go out with our friends and do not stay in touch. We send a message without words. If I am not your priority, you are not going to be mine. We become emotionally irresponsible without giving clarity to our partner. When we hurt we act out and attempt to hurt the other. We begin to doubt our importance and value in their lives. We begin to question our worth. This can spiral and get out of control. When we question our worth, we aim to protect ourselves in whatever way we can. Often it is in this boundary pushing. You probably know exactly how you do it. We need to start putting the right words to what we are feeling instead of making our partner pay for it. We need to create space for our partner is purpose, while still requesting to be their most prioritized human. It is not about testing their fight for us. It is about creating space for them to thrive in all the other areas of their life while calling them to show up for us .to prioritize us as their most important person. So talk. Share when you do not feel like a priority. And also remember to pay attention to all the ways our partners do make us a priority. Create a space for their purpose to thrive, and do not aim to strip them of that. Other things can be more important, we just want to be the most important human. Do not get purpose and passion confused with our role in their lives. Ask yourself have I prioritized my partner today?

I like when people use their words to communicate what they are feeling. I think it is a pretty effective way of being heard and understanding things.

So often in that space, a person is whispering to themselves of course I want you to stay, but I can not control you you have to decide on your own. OR, I am so sorry, I would do anything to repair this, but I am so ashamed and embarrassed of my actions I am not even convinced you should forgive me. Certainly, that is not always the case sometimes an ending is just that. Sometimes that person just does not want back in, or does not care. Sometimes after an affair, there really is not remorse and the person is ready to end things altogether. The point is, silence can mean so much more than we ever give it credit for. Be curious about silence instead of just making assumptions. Begging and pleading is not always the right way to communicate something.

It is the one that ignites the soul and sends signals loud signals that scream this is the one!!!! This feeling is incredible. A familiar soul that walks into our lives and starts to change it all with us. These people are special they make us believe again and give beautiful hope for a future. We start to fantasize and imagine a future together. Our souls are aligned. But sometimes souls being aligned is not actually our life long partner. Sometimes souls being aligned is so that a life lesson is experienced. Sometimes the aligning of souls is meant to call us to be greater but not necessarily greater with that person. Sometimes, these people are our soul helpers. They kick us further, shed light, remind us that the feeling still exists but that it is not enough. It will not be enough until the lessons are learned. They help us along the way, but are not our mates. We need to experience gratitude for these people. They are helping get us closer .closer to ourselves and ultimately closer to that soul that will scream I am coming with you. It is okay to confuse soul helpers but work towards gratitude for their help in your story. They are always getting you closer if you allow it.'},\n",

We want the outcome without the process the journey the lessons or the growth. We fantasize about the end results, but either do not demand more from ourselves in the here and now, or do not give ourselves permission to succeed.

I was just thinking that we would all be better humans if we could be more like dogs. Great listeners, forgiving, compassionate, attuned gosh, the list really goes on. I have had my guy, go ahead, give him some love , for a little over 6 years, and what is so remarkable about our relationship is that as it grows and changes with every year, one thing always stays the same: our joy and excitement every time we see each other. My reaction to him when I walk through the door is always the same. Every single day for the last 6 years I know I am going to be met with love, and that I am going to give it away. Sure there are things he does that I do not like, but there are way more things that he does that I do. And when he screws up, I do not assume that he is out to get me, I trust that he does not know any better or that I did not train him well enough. And no matter what each of our days have been like, the moment I walk through that door, the love and joy takes over. You see, there is a trust in love. It does not waiver even when everything else around us does. Yes yes, I know this is a relationship with a dog I know humans are far more complicated but maybe one of the great takeaways is that when we trust love when we are rooted in it, the rest of the stuff does not have to make us doubt so much. If we can assume the best in our dog, why not work towards assuming the best in our partner? Let is trust that our partner is doing his or her best. Let is assume good intent. Let is be rooted in love and focus on the good instead of only highlighting the bad. Let is meet each other with love, and be convinced that walking through that door is going to fill us with joy.

Maybe we are all just being fooled into fantasizing about a 'happily ever after'. These concerns and fears are voiced and thought around the world every day. We fear that if we are not living it, it will not come. Or we see plenty of relationships around us failing, and lose faith that 'it' even exists. Maybe the couple you thought was so great is getting a divorce. Or your friends tells you about how miserable he is but he can not leave. Maybe someone is spouse was found on the Ashley Madison website. Maybe all hope for a better future just seems so distant and so we surrender to bitterness and doubt. We let fear take over and use the truths we see as a way to support it. Drake continues his quote So we live our lives looking for something to fill us and give us meaning. Only to discover that in the end, love was never meant to be received by one person but rather all the people who make us feel at home. We do not have to become bitter about love. We have to open ourselves up to it. We fear never living to meet love instead of opening our eyes to see the love that is already all around us. We put pressure on a love that sweeps us off our feet, instead of reminding ourselves to be grounded and rooted in the moments that have given us that gift already. You see, sometimes love is just an insane collection of moments. Not a destination, but a story. A story about a compilation of love that is been thrown our way. You have already met love. It may not be in the form of a life long partner or marriage just yet and it may not be a fairy tale, or a fantasy meticulously planned but it is in other forms. Do not let bitterness and fear lead you astray from love. Find gratitude. Highlight your collection of moments, and open yourself up to receiving love in its different shapes and sizes. You have met love, and love has met you. No need to dismiss it just because it has not taken the shape you have planned for it.\"},\n",

Let them have adventures in the wild without you Let them face their fears, let them crash and burn, let them rise up. And know, deep down, that heroes are not qualified by their capacity to stay but by their decision to return. The way a person leaves reveals so much. Yes, we know on some level they have to and maybe even that it is the right thing but the way in which they do it reflects their level of functioning. Does the person communicate clearly, do they shut down and just disappear, do they place all the blame on you, are they stepping into something new that elevates them, or going back to something that keeps them playing small? Are they inconsiderate, disrespectful, mean, shut down, or defensive, or are they kind, calm, honest, and willing to take ownership for where they are right now? We can not keep a person from leaving that is not our job, but we can learn a lot about a person by the way in which they do it and similarly we can learn a lot about ourselves. Most people prefer clear closure. People have a yearning to understand. We want to make sense of things. We believe that if we can understand, then we can be released. Unfortunately, some people leave and they do not or can not give us the clarity we seek. They do not provide answers. They do not help us understand. What I say to that? We have all of the answers we seek from others within us. We have all of the closure we could ever need if we just allow ourselves to go there if we are willing to admit what it is we have been denying or convincing ourselves out of. I promise we have all of the answers we need as long as we give ourselves permission to go there. Your closure is on the other side of your comfort zone.'},\n",

Very rarely do we slow down to try to understand the different layers and parts that contribute to the problem. You see, our society tends to see an issue and then fix or change the issue as quickly as possible without considering more than the presenting problem. This is a problem. If you take anything away from this post, take this: we are all a part of many different systems and the way each part of the system functions impacts the other parts and the whole. We are a part of a family system, friendship system, work system, community, team etc. We have a role in all of these systems. And we feel a certain way about ourselves in those systems. We have a job to do, and if we do not do it well, the whole system will be impacted. Similarly, if the rest of the system is not doing their part, it will be difficult for you to thrive in your role. But most systems do not like to take any ownership for their part when another part is not succeeding. Sure, we can all independently thrive, but we will always be at our best if all parts of the system are functioning at their greatest. So when that flower is not blooming, we do not just send the flower off to therapy we do not just tell that flower that it needs to get its act together or else. We look at the other parts of the system. We change the amount of sunlight or water we check the soil. Ideally, the flower, water, sun, and soil would all come into therapy and we would talk about each part but seriously. We have to stop placing blame on just one part of any system. Check the environment. If someone is struggling ask yourself what you could be doing differently? If one part of your system is not great, you have a part in that. And if you are struggling, know it is not all on you. If we can start improving our systems our environments the parts would all do better.'},\n",

We have to give ourselves permission to be loved, and we have to understand what it is that keeps us from receiving it. Two things to address: our narratives, and our love languages. It is important to understand our inner narrative we need to understand what it is we tell ourselves each and every day about being loved. Do we believe it? Are we worthy of love? Or have we come to accept that we are unlovable? We need to dissect that further and understand from where those narratives come? What were we told about love growing up? How did we receive it? Was it conditional? Were we made to fear the withdrawal of love? When we understand what drives our narratives, we can gain more control over our thoughts. We can begin to challenge parts of our narrative that keep us from receiving love, and we can expand on the parts that do not . The second part is understanding our love languages. Often we give and receive love differently than those around us. Research has boiled the languages down to FIVE: acts of service, quality time, words of affirmation, physical touch, and gifts. These are the ways we all give and receive love but just think If your love languages are quality time and physical touch, but your partner gives thoughtful gifts and words of affirmation to demonstrate his love for you, it is easy to question whether or not the love is even there. We begin to believe that if people do not love in the same way we do, then love does not exist. That is a myth, and one that needs to be challenged. I will explain how over on Periscope in a bit.

We become attached to the outcome of being right, instead of listening to understand. It is so easy to stay focused on the content.

Being kind is more important than being right. I know that can be tough sometimes, especially when we know that we are right.

Remember, when people are wrong, it is easy to be embarrassed, so taking ownership during that time can be difficult. Let is take a step back and not rub a person is nose in the dirt.

Regardless of how great or awful they are, they are human which means they are imperfect. They have let us down, they have said the wrong things sometimes it is only from time to time if we are lucky and other times it is all the time. Some of us have been supported and loved, and others have been abused and abandoned. Our life stories are all very unique, but one thing is for sure our families can not do it all and they can not do it all right. I adore this quote. I work with a lot of people who have not always had the most beautiful story. They are hurt by the decisions, words, and actions of their family members. They feel alone and unimportant. They question if they have ever been loved, and if their family even cares about them. One of the things that we work on is expanding our definition of family. Maybe it does not have to only be blood. Maybe family is anyone who shows up? Maybe we get to create who we keep in the intimate space with us. I have noticed that people do much better once they release themselves from a narrative about family that only defines it as blood related. We have been given the message that blood is thicker than water except maybe it is not. Maybe blood is only thicker than water when it is showing up. When it is well and alive. Family is supposed to be there they are supposed to care the most. It is unconditional love. Except a lot of times it is not. And that is tough. Except when we have friends who are our blessings friends who change the game. Friends who listen to understand. Friends who would drop anything for you. Friends who make a storm feel peaceful. Friends who have the right words to say. Not all of us can have great families but we are all given the opportunity to create a family system filled with friends.

We seem to question whether it is okay to let people back in, or if we should just commit to when something is over it is over. There is not a one way fits all answer here. Second chances can be the most beautiful decision we have ever made. And saying hell no might be a response we never ever change or reconsider. I would like to offer two things to consider in helping decide what decision makes the most sense for you. When someone tries to re-enter your life, make sure you understand the growth they have achieved while they were away. If you are going to let someone back in, they should be able to clearly explain how they have grown, and what areas they know will be different they need awareness otherwise, it is likely that you will create the same patterns that led to that ending in the first place. Secondly, ask yourself what is driving your decision? For example, do you want to say yes because you have clearly understood their growth, or is it because you are tired of being alone? Make sure your motivating force is clean. And consider what it will be like if it ends for the second time. Can you be at peace with that? Is it okay for this person to re-enter and only take you a little bit further in your journey? Sometimes our answers are through trial and error, but if people want to re-enter without doing any work, it is likely a decision that will create the same outcome as before. Do not show up for mediocre love. Open yourself up to greater love. Sometimes that is from a former lover and sometimes that is someone else out there in this big, grand world.'},\n",

Ten gallon people need ten gallon people to fill them up anything else is not going to feel like enough. But it is important to recognize that the pint sized people in your life are actually loving you with everything they have. It may never feel like enough because their pints will never fill your gallon well, but you need to know that most of them are giving everything they have. From the start, Jakes says, some parents are not capable of giving an outpouring of love to their children, because they have a pint-sized capacity and cannot fill those who have a 10-gallon capacity to love. This is important because it is the first example of love we receive. If our parents or caretakers are not ten gallon people but we are, we may start to question whether love is meant to feel the way we feel it? Maybe we question if we are enough since we never feel full of love? The doubt can take over. Maybe we think we are supposed to partner with someone who has a pint capacity. Maybe that is all we are supposed to get? Those narratives can become loud. If you are a ten gallon person, no need to be ashamed of that.

I want to be clear that we ALL have the capacity to be ten gallon people, it is just that our hurt and our wounds can keep us from loving all out and showing up whole. We are fully capable of healing those parts and expanding pints into gallons. That said, when we give love away to people who are not able to show up and give love back, we are going to question ourselves. It is natural and normal to do so. But, we need to start to understand that their love is a reflection of them and not us. Too often we question whether WE are good enough lovable enough important enough. We doubt ourselves when the love is not there. Sometimes, we choose people who can only show up that much because it reflects a narrative that tells us that it is all we get. You see, over time, we believe that it is all we are worthy of. We keep loving as much as we can loving all out..working hard for greater love, but still wind up getting the same, pint size love, in return. We are all worthy of great love ten gallon love. We are all capable of giving it away and receiving it, but the quality of love we are able to give and receive is connected to our sense of self and the healing we have achieved. So keep working on yourself. Keep healing. And know that your beautiful love is not the problem. Your narrative about the type of love you should receive might be but remember that the people who are not loving all out are likely hurting and have not found a way to heal just yet.'},\n",

It is a beautiful sign that healing is for the taking. Let that sink in. Every time we hurt, we need to remind ourselves that a form of recovery is on its way. I adore that line, each tragedy is an announcement that some good will indeed come in time. So know that we are ALL going through it. We have been there before and we will be there again.

When we are so blinded by the hurt and pain, the rejection can paralyze us and support old narratives that say what is wrong with me? Will someone ever want me? When someone walks away we must find a way to say thank you. I know that can sometimes feel impossible, but both people are in need of the ending. The person leaving has to, and the one being left needs to be redirected. That person can only take you so far in your growth so, say thank you thank you for leading me this far, and for creating room for someone else to lead me further.

In that process it is easy to fill our minds with narratives that damn love and our hope for a future with someone. Maybe we question our selves and our worth? Maybe we question whether we are lovable or if we will ever wind up with someone? Maybe we start comparing ourselves to our friends who have found their happily ever after and wonder what is wrong with us that we have not found it. This space is critical. These narratives can keep us from our great love. When we start to lose hope it can literally block love from approaching us. The absence of hope can make it difficult for love to find its way in. If we are spending our time doubting ourselves and questioning our worth, we are not spending it growing and bettering ourselves. We are not putting beautiful energy out into the world and we are certainly not showing up for our purpose and our passions. Someone not loving us creates space for someone who wants to.

We ask for security and safety in a relationship by trying to control outcomes. We show up differently than who we are in hopes that it is a version that someone else will want. Tampering with love never works. When we try to control outcomes we taint and dilute love. It is no longer pure. I know it is not easy, but we will do much better in this life if we learn to love without an attachment to outcomes.

Do not minimize it. Do not hide. As we grow and gain wisdom along the way we begin to see the areas that may have been neglected. The messages we have believed that we are now beginning to question. We start to see that maybe they were not the all knowing people we once thought they were. We begin to disagree and challenge parts that we have lived by for a long time. It is never too late to be the person we needed when we were growing up. It is never too late to start sending a new message of strength. It is not too late to challenge narratives to step out of cultural expectations that do not align with us, and to show up for ourselves. You have permission to be that person for yourself. You have permission to show up, and you have permission to ask others to show up, too. You have permission to challenge and disagree and write a new belief system. You have permission to grow and live differently than what may have been set out for you. You have that permission to be the person you have always needed and you are worthy of receiving that from others who are able to show up in that space. Allow yourself to be the person you have always needed, and then start to invite others into that space. You are your most beautiful opportunity for healing. Be gentle and kind to yourself. Forgive yourself for not doing it sooner. You are learning and you are applying a beautiful new truth.'},\n",

The perfect child, the perfect friend, the perfect employee, the perfect parent, the perfect partner. When in all actuality, we are beautifully wired for imperfection. It is rooted in our internal mapping, it lives deep within our own personal coding. Our flaws make us who we are, they fuel our own unique purpose and what we have to offer the world that NO ONE else can. So why is it so hard to show that side of us? I spent a lot of time energy trying to hide the real me, mainly out of fear and the belief I created in my head that no one would love my messy parts. So I went throughout life living in the story that what I had to offer was not good enough and I molded myself around the idea of what I thought I should be. It took a handful of heartbreak and a few bruised egos for me to figure out that what I was attracting in my life that was feeding into my unhappiness was out of the fact the universe was giving me people and circumstances that were aligned with the fake image I was showing up as. It is called sympathetic vibrations for we magnetize and receive what we put out there. When I chose to stop trying to become something I was not , and chose to un-become and unfold to who I have always been by shifting my perception and shedding the stories, I was able to be the girl that struggles, the girl that fails, the girl feels everything, but also the girl is unabashedly herself, the girl that is beautifully vulnerable and loves all-out without fear or regret.

It is inherently human to want to understand why we do what we do so we can make sense of it. When we understand it, it can breed more awareness, and awareness is a giant step towards change. But it is easy to get stuck in the need to understand And it is also easy to get fixated on the work and addicted to personal growth.. because if we are growing then no one will ask us questions no one will force us to actually do anything. We get to play the language game and dance in the semantics of working on ourselves . So sometimes it is much simpler to just let go of the need to make it all make sense. Some stuff and people will just never be understood. And thankfully, understanding our past is not the only way to move beyond it. It takes the desire to change for change to take place. We can decide, in this second, that we will never be a lesser version than what we are capable of. We can choose, that from this moment forward we will not tolerate mediocrity from ourselves or others. Our lives are composed of so many moments and experiences, and the beautiful thing is that we get to decide what they all mean for us. Letting go of the need to understand our past does not mean we have forgotten it, it just means that we have learned that the present we are constructing is more important than a past we cannot change.'},\n",

There is an essential component to all great relationships that from an intellectual level is super simple but can be much more challenging to implement; the best partners have great boundaries . And it does not just stop at great relationship partners, it is what having amazing boundaries communicates to those around us that we believe we deserve the highest level of respect. The advice we usually receive is this area is the typically flippant suggestion to just stand up for yourself or just tell her him what you want need . If it was that simple, we would all do it. All of us would be getting what we want and life would be all puppy dogs and ice cream. But it is not. Because the reality is that having strong boundaries can often be misconstrued as saying no to love. Or that we are not accepting someone as they are with their struggles. Having strong boundaries is saying no to mediocrity for us, from us, and from others. And I want you to see that having effective boundaries has a beautiful side-effect ; it communicates to us that what we want is important, and that we have a high level of self worth. To the person receiving the boundary the message is similar this person loves and respects themselves so much that they will not accept this behavior from me. Self-worth is like food, we need it constantly or we will begin to starve and the food we need is having a life that reflects the decisions and choices that someone with a high level of self-respect would have. It takes a commitment to who we want to be and the life we want for it to become so and know that these things can all be cultivated over time. We do not need to be perfect, we just need to strive for progress.

I do not ever want to be complete. For me, being complete means being a finished project, and I am a forever-evolving human being. I am a masterpiece on my own terms. I never want to stop learning, stop growing, stop drinking up and experiencing this life for all it has to offer me. I hold no emptiness in my heart, yet I intentionally keep empty spaces in my life for magic this space creates a strange pull that attracts radical creation and collaboration and other human beings like me that hold me accountable to keep reaching for more. For I would not meet them if those spaces were full. If I filled these empty spaces up with mediocrity people and things that did not light me up and have me screaming YES then I would not be living in my truth. Do not think of empty spaces as being bad or wrong, because they are only empty until what is right for you comes along.'},\n",

For many, this acceptance and time to discover ourselves and what we have learned is too much to bear. BUT We must. Because in that space is where we do the building and become a stronger and better partner for the next person. I know that the pain of loss can be so great that sometimes we just want company . But if we go into something too early and when we are not happy yet alone, we put that on our partners. They become our bandaid to dealing with what is really going on in our hearts.

Not all toxic people in our lives have cruel hearts or are inherently bad people, a lot of the time they have pure and loving intentions for us. But just because people hold great love for us, does not necessarily mean they are right for us. A lot of the time toxicity in a relationship forces us to compromise our well-being simply because the other person is needs and emotions overshadow ours. Maybe they are not choosing to grow side-by side with us and would rather shrink back into what is comfortable, maybe they are not at the level of self-loving awareness we are, or maybe they are unable to maintain their happiness and rely on us to do all of the work for them. Whatever it may look like for you, if it is holding you back or causing you to sacrifice your happiness to keep them secure in your relationship, it is usually best for both parties if you let them go. Being a human being is work on its own, let alone trying to be everything for someone else too. When we step up and fill the gaps in others for them, instead of with them, we not only enable them to flatline, it also becomes exhausting and unsustainable for ourselves. Whether it be letting go of relationship with a love, a friend or a family member, sometimes you must love people from a distance. You should never have to apologize for removing yourself from a situation that is painful or hurtful for you or to you. Reclaim your space and make yourself your priority, it is always okay to create a safer space for you and your happiness.'},\n",

Not just in the anniversary and Valentine is Day kind of way, more so in a weekly fashion. If you have kids, remember you are always a couple before you are parents, you must make the time to cultivate your relationship. We often hear that wouldate nights' are really important, and although that is true, I want us to recognize that it actually requires a little more than just having time together. It requires the time together to have novelty, adventure, and co-creation , Sure, a night on the couch watching movies and making dinner is great But we have done it 1000 times. We know what to expect A massage and some booty hopefully . So there is no surprise. Humans require novelty Old relationships become old because we do not keep things new. This is so important to understand. And relationships that have date nights will do ok.. They will be averagely good. But couples that try new things together and cultivate new memories are more likely to thrive. Because doing new things which are exciting and adventurous, tricks our brains and hearts into associating our partner with those things Making them feel new and reigniting connection. That is one of the best ways to keep love alive. Let is quit being lazy and doing the same old sh t.

Suddenly any word they say, their mere presence in a room, their name being brought into conversation, or even a selfie being posted on social media can take us from zero to pissed in a matter of moments. Anger is easy. Hating is easy. It means we do not have to fully own how it is we really actually feel deep down inside. Hurt. Abandoned. Ego bruised. Or maybe we are just mad at ourselves for still holding love for them. This way of being allows us to stay in a mentality where it is all them and not us. How could we still have love for someone that broke our hearts? But that is the thing though. By us choosing to not love, we are actually doing an even greater disservice to ourselves. Hate is too heavy a burden to carry around. It is not fertile ground for acceptance or change, it is not a space that fosters growth or evolution. By us choosing to love people, choosing to love them through the process, through our letting go, is one of the strongest things we can ever do. Love is light, it flows freely. It creates opportunity for you to move forward without any attachment or baggage. It allows you to celebrate who people were for you, and who they still are for you, because at one moment in time you both were exactly what you needed. They helped shape us into who we are today and what is there to hate about that? No matter what people say or do or how badly they may hurt us, it is never too late to forgive and show love for people, even if that means loving from a distance and even if that means no longer having them as part of your life.

Healing can not happen without hurt. And if we just run from it constantly, we are not actually allowing ourselves to take away what it is we need to apply next time. Sure, it is lousy. We do not wish for it, but when we lean into it to gain its teachings, we come out the other side wiser.

We are touching lives, and we are meaning a tremendous amount to others. We are hours for some, days, weekends, months, years, or lifetimes .and it all matters. The good the bad the lessons. Most of our relationships are the helpers. They budge us a little closer, and we budge them. We reveal hard truths, and they challenge fears. We leap and they do not and sometimes they leap and it is just not for us. The process of moving closer can be a tough one. It is painful at times the perception of rejection, or the narratives that sink in a bit further that hear us repeating will I ever find love? We touch people is lives all the time. Never forget that. And keep holding hope, because somewhere along the way it will be at the same time. You will leap, and they will leap.

When I was getting my masters at Northwestern, I was fortunate to be a part of leading an undergraduate course called Marriage 101 . It was the course that we have all wanted at least knew we wanted since middle school. I mean, I love Algebra and do use it but let is be real, learning how to be in a healthy, successful relationship romantic, friendship, familial, professional is what it is all about. We NEED this, but not many of us get it. So Marriage 101 started teaching college kids everything it is we all wished we knew about relationships. We started talking about boundaries, partner selection, what goes into the greatest relationship, and how to create that for ourselves. It goes without surprise that still to this day it is the most popular and sought after elective at Northwestern. I would love this to be taught in elementary school, but it is not yet so instead, we will take the approach of it is never too late and I will invite you to join me in VANCOUVER for a Relationship 101 event.

Healing is trying to nudge itself into our consciousness. The lessons may be delivered with painful packaging but it is through the process of unwrapping it all that we come to discover the gifts. It is not our timeline. We just have to keep moving ourselves through the pain. We have to keep our head lifted to look for the good that is amidst the pain.

Too many of us run into the arms of perceived togetherness because we do not like ourselves when we are alone. The narratives we tell ourselves are cruel and untrue, but we have subscribed to them and commit to avoiding ourselves. It is important that we are able to enjoy our alone that we successfully learn how to exist in that space, and use it as a marker to know when a person adds true value to our lives or when they are just being used as a filler. You see, that is the problem when we do not love our solitude. We confuse love. We confuse feeling better with simply avoiding. We often hear that we must love ourselves before someone else can or that we have to be happy alone before we can be happy with another person. I am not sure that is always true, that there are not exceptions to that but what I do think is important is that if we need a person to help us avoid ourselves than we can not ever have our greatest love with them. We essentially wind up using them to escape ourselves, instead of using people to embrace it all. Improve your solitude so you can love and be loved fully. Love your alone, so that you are clear when a person actually enhances your life instead of helps you avoid it. We all have the capacity to love ourselves.

It hurts so much when we leap and people are not there to catch us. So of course it makes sense that time after time pushes us into a space where we have walls up. It is easy to shut down it is easy to stay guarded it is easy to turn away from vulnerability when we do not trust that the people on the other side will hear us. But what we have to keep doing is keep sharing ourselves over and over again. Just because most people up until now have not gotten it, does not mean that our future does not hold security in that space. The only way we have a chance at it is by sharing our heart.

It is easy to question if this relationship can only take you so far? It is easy to fantasize about a connection that is just deeper or simply easier. It is easy to think that somewhere along the way we just took a turn away from each other. It is easy to throw in the towel. Sometimes it winds up being necessary and the right decision, but other times it is testing and growing you. It is demanding more. Underneath all of the doubt, confusion, anger, criticism, and frustration is misunderstanding, hurt, pain, and emotional needs that are not getting met. It is tough when we are at the end of our rope to have the motivation to do the work with one another, but it is possible. I want you to know it is possible. That does not guarantee an outcome, but I am amazed by the capacity of human beings. I am amazed day in and day out by people who just prove time and time again that there is hope even when two people can not see it. Most of the time when we get to this point, you will need professional help, but this is also a good reminder to check in with your partner often. Ask, how was I as a partner this week? What could I have done better? Do you feel heard and understood do you feel secure? Stay on it before your lack of energy keeps you from trying as hard.

Sometimes we need to calm ourselves down and clear our minds, and I often suggest time outs for couples, but it is important not to abandon. It is important to create safety and security even when time is needed to cool off. It is easy to stay when things are going well, but we need to learn how to stay even when things are tough. It is in the mess that we tend not to feel safe. So this is about creating that security, working on communication, helping your partner understand and learn that even though it is tough right now, the two of you will be able to get through it together. Our partners need to know, to truly know, that we are not leaving even when the going gets tough. We all need security. We all need to trust in our ability to work through it. Eliminate criticism, defensiveness, contempt and stonewalling total shutting down . John Gottman is data shows that these are relationship killers , and when present, keep couples from creating security in their relationships. These things are leaving . They are a version of it. When we do any of them, we wind up abandoning what is most important. We wind up stepping away from our hurt and hearing one another, and we either go on the attack or just shut down. We have to work ourselves away from that, otherwise we are always just chipping away at the relationship. Just because we come back afterwards, does not mean the damage is not done. It is.

Sometimes it is not wrapped in a pretty bow with two people who amicably say this is for the better. Sure, maybe we know that is true on some level, but most of the time our closure seems to be messier than we wish it. I have found that one of the hardest parts of moving on is processing the loss of the fantasy of the future. It is not so much about it ending in that moment let is face it most of the time the relationship is not healthy anymore and it ending actually makes sense it is more about losing the thoughts about what life was going to be like with this person. What the future held with them the first house bought, the kids, the family traditions all of it. The loss of that can penetrate so deeply even if we have been unhappy for a long time. That is why this quote from is so helpful. You see, we get closer to closure when we accept that letting go of the fantasy of the future is something that is keeping us stuck.

Go check out the caption she wrote to her quote. It is SO normal to keep knocking at a closed door. It may seem like the answer is obvious, but when we are in it just in the trenches of it all, we are looking to get some type of message that contradicts the negative narrative that we have playing over and over again in our head. That door closing looks a whole lot like rejection. It really feels that way too, even when a part of us may know that it is just a redirection. Nonetheless, we want the person who has hurt us to be the person who changes how we feel. We want them to say something or do something that stops us from feeling what we are feeling that stops those negative narratives from running their course and we truly believe it is only they who can save us from it. That is just not true. We save ourselves by knocking and receiving the message but turning the distorted negative narrative into ones that reveals what it is we actually need. The hurt is real, but it is what we do with it that matters. Knocking over and over again is not so bad there is plenty to learn through that process, but it is about rewriting what we tell ourselves in that space. While we knock are we bashing ourselves, or are we trying to gain insight? While we knock are we trying to control an outcome, or are we clarifying answers and processing our confusion? That space is critical. And in it, we must allow ourselves to believe in a better future a future that holds stronger and healthy narratives. Ones that lift us up and trust in secure relationships. We keep knocking because we want a different answer but we are doing it expecting it from the wrong people. Knock and gain what it is you need, and then move on to the next door. It will be answered with newly written narratives that will lead you further.'},\n",

We fear that people will not be able to show up for us, or that they will just choose not to. We start to think I have been let down before, so why would this time be any different? So we step away from our needs we internalize them and cross or fingers in hopes that our people will just know. That someone will care about us enough to maybe just ask. There is always a narrative that is keeping us from speaking up. There is something there that is convincing us out of speaking our needs and openly sharing them with our partner. That is something for you to challenge and explore for yourself and identify. But here is something that is really important. The strongest couples are ones that can share it all with each other. They tell each other what it is they need. They tell each other how to love them. They build trust around when I have a need, you will hear it. They do not always meet every need that is not what it is about but they create an environment that feels safe to share and express it all. It is a space that feels safe to be vulnerable. These couples use their words the right way. They express their need in a way that is easy for their partner to understand. And their partner responds to it. That person lets them know it is been heard. We will always be let down when we do not ask for what we need. Our partners are not mind readers, and part of our growth is honoring ourselves in order to be heard. It is a lesson we can always use practice in. So work towards vulnerability. Work towards clearly communicating what your needs and expectations are, and give your partner a chance to show up and hear it. Every time you avoid yourself, you wind up abandoning your needs. Set people up for success set yourself up for success. Your words are the gateway to your needs being met.'},\n",

When we are in pain, it is far simpler for us to be reactive. It is easier for us to react from an emotionally flooded space.

We tend to add to the hurt by one upping being critical defensive or just shutting down. This does not help. And just because we are hurting does not mean we have free rein to put it right back out there. We are responsible for the way we respond. Of course we are human and we can not do it perfectly all of the time, but we need to become more accountable. It is not good enough to say I would not have done this if you had not done that . It does not work. We have to remember that everything we say and do sends a message to those around us. We need to ask ourselves if that message aligns with us if it aligns with what it is we really need, and if this is the best way that we can put the message out to the world or our partner?

That is not what makes us feel secure and safe in this world. It is about knowing that we can trust each other to work at it to work hard at it even when the going gets tough. We do not want perfect lives. We want to know that with this person I can get through any set of issues that present themselves.

We like knowing that if we do 'X', 'Y' will happen. We want certainty, and we want to know that if we work hard, practice more, stay up longer, put in the hours, read up, and apply we will have success. Sounds lovely yet somehow that does not always apply to relationships. We can give all of ourselves and do everything right , and it still will not be our choice if someone stays or goes. We can beg, plead, promise, change, be better, more attuned, and still still it is not all our choice. There is ALWAYS someone else that is choosing with us for us grrr when we are in a relationship. That is why love can be so scary; there is no certainty. Hollllldddd on . but we took vows! yes, you did. You promised to stay together NO MATTER WHAT. Whether you subscribe to that or not, what is not spoken in that space is a vow to remain happy forever a vow that we will not emotionally leave one another. Yes, you may not divorce or exit the relationship by actually physically leaving, but you may leave emotionally. Promising happiness forever or to emotionally be engaged at all times is not possible. We can not promise that because we are human. Period. So instead of looking to control outcomes and demand promises from others demand it from yourself. You are only in control of yourself and sometimes that is even a stretch . Promise what you know you can give and then talk about the rest. Focus on being the best partner. Focus on nurturing your happiness. Focus on strengthening the Self, and maintaining your roles and identity. Love yourself. Honor yourself. Honor your partner. Show up in the best way you can and then do better tomorrow. You will encourage the same in your partner you will attract that back and if you do not , you are still prepared to choose yourself even if someone else can not .\"},\n",

We have learned to encourage it and often we can even convince ourselves to look forward to it by turning lessons into growth. But sometimes we forget how much pain and hurt can accompany it. Maybe we need to slow down and not just jump to the outcome. Yes, growth is great, but we need to acknowledge that the weeks, months, and years leading up to it can be treacherous sometimes the most painful and difficult times of our lives. Yes, we will get there but processing through the loss mourning and grieving whatever it may be is a process that needs to be honored and understood. Too often we are quick to minimize it. Too often we forget about the bigger picture and just focus on the content. He was not good for you anyway. You will meet someone much better next. This may be spoken with the hope of encouraging a friend or family member, but the loss is far greater than the person. It is layers of loss that we do not always understand. It is loss of the future. It is loss of self esteem. It is loss of a role and major part of an identity. Wherever we have an opportunity for growth, we are always having to mourn a part of ourselves that we are giving up. That can be anything. But with growth comes leaving something behind and even if it is ultimately for something great, there is still a process that needs deliberate, compassionate attention. Be kind to yourself. No need to rush. Your mourning is teaching you something. Your growth will come from it, but honor it and understand the different layers of loss first.'},\n",

I want to give my children what my parents gave me. I want to provide so much more than what I got. Can I even do this? Will my relationship fail? Is it okay if I want to work and be a mom?

This is for the people who tend to be the ones getting broken up with this is for the people who get left more than they do the leaving. Hell, maybe you have never broken up with anyone in your life. So let is look at it. What was your role in the family? Did you have to keep things together for everyone? Did you avoid voicing any issues or problems to the family in fear that they could not handle any more? Maybe they were dealing with SO much already, so you felt there was not any room for you to bring any of your stuff to them? Maybe your parents got divorced and you were asked to choose between the two and you wanted to make sure that no one is feelings got hurt so you quieted your wants and just tried to make everyone happy. Or maybe you tried voicing something and you got punished for it. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. I do not know your story, but I do know there are fears that keep us from honoring ourselves and I know that there are narratives that support those fears. Narratives that keep you from honoring your voice speaking your truth, and trusting that it is okay to. Maybe you are afraid of hurting others letting them down. Maybe you do not know that it is safe to step into that space for fear of something bad happening. Whatever it is it needs your attention. It needs to be understood because sometimes we do have to go. Sometimes we do have to end things. But we always have to honor ourselves.

It is through this process that parts will heal. Maybe not all or at least not all at once but the moment you allow yourself to go through is the moment you heal a part of the hurt. You finally send yourself the message my hurt matters to me and I will honor it. Think about that message! Think about how beautiful that is. Those simple words. I will not ignore you, I will listen to you. Gosh, how many of us have been waiting to hear that our entire lives?!? So please realize your own power that you can sometimes be your own healer. That letting go does not mean forgetting or pretending something never happened. Letting go just means releasing from the ways we have all ignored our pain. Repeat once more: I will not ignore myself, I will listen to myself, and I will let myself feel.'},\n",

Being a great partner demands that we allow our partners to be there for us to show up. It demands that we ask for our needs to get met, and that we communicate them clearly. Great partnership goes both ways. Do not get stuck thinking you are a great partner because of how much you give. Remember that you have to find ways to receive as well otherwise our partners do not have a chance of giving us their beautiful love. It is not for you to take that away from them. Do not deny them their role and purpose in your life. And if this feels difficult for you to do, consider the narratives that are keeping you stuck. What are the messages you received around receiving love, or being able to ask for things? Were you always the giver in your family? Was that your role? Were you allowed to have needs? Try to understand what keeps you stuck so that you can loosen yourself from those messages. You are not just a giver. That is not the only role for you.

You are not unlovable, but you will feel that way when relationships end and you find yourself uttering this always happens to me. You are not unlovable, but you will certainly feel that way when you do not give yourself permission to have a new narrative. There are people who will take on the task of loving you back to life. They will take on the task of disproving all of your negative narratives. They will take on creating safety and security where there is always been fear. They will take it all on, but first you must give it permission. Please join and me in NYC on February 15th as we explore being single in the city. We will explore our past, our narratives, why we choose who we choose, how to break out patterns, and how to set ourselves up for relational success. We will be releasing ticket info to you tomorrow at 12 pm EST. Stay tuned for ticket info then so you do not miss out. Only 60 tickets available for that event.'},\n",

We wake up and go to sleep with ourselves every morning and every night. We are our inner narratives. We are the lens through which we see all. We are. The love inside of us must belong to ourselves first, before we can purely give it away to others. We are meant to love. We are meant to create safety and security for others, and to give love and a sense of belonging to those special people in our lives. We are meant to listen and understand. We are meant to do these things, but if we only do it because we need it from someone else, then the love was never meant for them it was manipulated to be for us. We do not have to manipulate love if we have it first for ourselves. So if self love is missing something has to change. Love yourself back to life. Love your narratives. Love your lens.

Unfortunately, in the immediate aftermath of perceived loss we tend to experience emotional flooding. That means that our rational brain is not functioning at its greatest. That makes it difficult for us to tell ourselves that everything will be okay this is happening for me and not to me and that there is beautiful growth to be had. Instead we are likely to curse the situation or person , act out, question our worth, and make a strong case for life being against us. It is not until later that we are generally able to see the loss as a blessing. It is important to feel our feelings, but it is also important to assume the best: that even though we may not see it in this moment, we are gaining something. One of the most important assumptions in a relationship is assuming good intent assuming the best in our partner. This has a lot to do with the quality of our relationships but the reason I bring this up is that it is important to apply this with life. With the things that are going on around us. Assume good intent. Assume you are being looked after because if you assume you are not, you will be wrong most of the time. We are too focused on the negative instead of searching desperately for what is being gained. That should be the focus. If you assume ill intent you will always suffer more so take the opportunity to search search for the beauty search for the gain believe in the positive believe that you are being held hold faith and hope.

       "  'pre_cleaned_text': 'Read this!! To give a second or third chance or to not? This question gets asked so often. But what if he changed? She says she is ready now! We seem to question whether it is okay to let people back in, or if we should just commit to when something is over it is over. There is not a one way fits all answer here. Second chances can be the most beautiful decision we have ever made. And saying hell no might be a response we never ever change or reconsider. I would like to offer two things to consider in helping decide what decision makes the most sense for you. When someone tries to re-enter your life, make sure you understand the growth they have achieved while they were away. If you are going to let someone back in, they should be able to clearly explain how they have grown, and what areas they know will be different they need awareness otherwise, it is likely that you will create the same patterns that led to that ending in the first place. Secondly, ask yourself what is driving your decision? For example, do you want to say yes because you have clearly understood their growth, or is it because you are tired of being alone? Make sure your motivating force is clean. And consider what it will be like if it ends for the second time. Can you be at peace with that? Is it okay for this person to re-enter and only take you a little bit further in your journey? Sometimes our answers are through trial and error, but if people want to re-enter without doing any work, it is likely a decision that will create the same outcome as before. Do not show up for mediocre love. Open yourself up to greater love. Sometimes that is from a former lover and sometimes that is someone else out there in this big, grand world.'},\n",

We so often think we know best. It is my life, so I am in charge. except sometimes it does not go according to our plan. Not because life is against us, but because there is something greater out there. Sometimes what is for us comes after what we perceive to be rejections or failures. Did not get the job? Could not make the relationship work? Easy to subscribe to being a failure easy to accept that maybe dating or marriage is not for us, or that we are just meant to be unhappy. I would like to challenge that thought. What we wanted 10 years ago, 5, 1, maybe months ago is different than what we may want now. That is good. We should be changing. We should be growing and learning new things about ourselves and the people we keep close. The problem is that we often see change as a negative. We should be accepted just as we are. No one should try to change us. ETC ETC. Seriously, it goes on and on but we need to shift that thinking. You DO have to change. You should not be okay with being the same person today as the person you will be in a year, or 5 or 10. Sometimes that means the people, the work, and the fun changes with you. Sometimes it stays the same because the people on your ride are growing with you but sometimes it is not them. Sometimes people grow at different speeds or different directions. That does not need to be a failure. Embrace your growth, embrace playing big and stepping into yourself. What does it mean to choose yourself every year. What stays the same, what changes, what gets challenged? You are not a failure. You are just on a road to searching for something greater. It is there. Step into it. Change. You are not a sculpture.

What is so beautiful is that two people who give it away freely, actually wind up receiving abundantly. It is a type of love that commits to creating safety and security for the other it is a message that says I want you to be okay to feel okay that is my commitment to you. When we say things like if you do this, I will love you , or promise me you will never leave me , we actually wind up manipulating love. We send the message that we need to control certain things in order to feel safe and secure. It is backwards. That is not actually security. And unfortunately, it is not actually pure love. It is fear that takes over. It is fear that needs to control. And it is fear that keeps us from great love. So think about how love has presented itself in your life. Did you feel loved by your dad? Your mom? Your caretakers? Was fear there? Did love get withdrawn if you did something wrong? Did someone leave the family? Did it make you fear being abandoned? Is that why controlling love makes you feel safer? Please think about your story. Think about the meaning of love and what you do to protect yourself.

We are convinced that perfection is what people want but what people really want is to see the flawed and human parts. Those are the part that are binding. Those are the part that join us together.

Over at we are doing our best not to forget that. Truth is, children try and test us constantly, and they often shed light on our blind spots. Sometimes children teach us compassion in areas where we have lost it, or they challenge our patience and demand that we find new ways to react sometimes children remind us of a playfulness we have buried, or that life is better lived while laughing. But beyond that, if we allow it, children give us an opportunity to do things differently to get it right to create a story with them that either propels them safely into the world, or fearfully into insecurity, doubt, and uncertainty. One of my favorite questions to ask people thinking about having a child, expecting parents, or current parents is: when your child is on their therapist is sofa in 15 20 years and he or she asks them about their childhood and parents, what will they say? What will their story be? How will they describe you and the way you loved them? Think about that. Let that in. Let your actions, words, and love reflect what it is you want their story to be.

We should never walk away from a relationship in the same way we walked in. The victory is in the transformation. Read that over. The victory is in the transformation it is in the process. Everyone we meet serves a purpose in our lives. They are our teachers. Some enter with a deeper lesson to deliver, some shed a reminding spotlight others are our mirrors, and some our darkest triggers. We are these lessons for others, too. Change is a beautiful thing. As we open ourselves up to it, we give ourselves permission to get closer to our most authentic selves. We get closer to our purpose and our passion. So walk around as a student. Be a student to everyone around you and assume the role of teacher for others as well.

Questions like, you seem like you have it all together, why are you still single? Or, you are so beautiful, why have not you been able to find someone? These questions contain a very faulty message. Truth is, being single and happy is far greater than being in a relationship and unhappy. No matter how you slice it. Unhealthy relationships are not better than being alone especially when your alone is damn good. Sometimes people do not need saving sometimes people love their alone so much that they will only accept a relationship that enhances it. Sometimes it is not actually a pity party. And sometimes NOTHING is actually wrong with the person at all go figure ; . So maybe we should try to shift our thinking around this maybe we should consider being single as a beautiful choice for so many. One that keeps boundaries in place, and does not support avoidance of self or loneliness. It is not always the case, but it is important to shift out that lens. Be considerate with your questions. Be thoughtful with your approach. Do not assume that just because someone is not dating, that there is something wrong with them gosh that is awful.

Let is not let that get in the way of the message! When we experience hurt or pain along the way, and do not have a safe space to share it and have it be heard, we start turning to defense mechanisms to try and stop the pain. It is where we find our safe place . So to protect this place, we start to build a wall around it. Over time, that wall grows sometimes it comes down a bit, but if we get hurt during the process, it shoots back up and sometimes grows even higher. We try to protect ourselves by avoiding by shutting our hearts off or by convincing ourselves that we do not need much. But it is not true and it is not the real safety we actually want. We need people who knock down that wall or climb over it. We need people who know that there is a heart behind the defense that is looking for safety and security to know that we are enough that we belong and that we are lovable. We need people who help us lift out of the roles that keep us stuck. And we need people who are ready to do that work with us. Who choose us. Who show up.

I spoke about this image at the Relationships 101 Event in Vancouver a few months ago and am always so deeply impacted when I see the image again and think of its meaning. There is a child inside all of us. A child who continues to reach out towards hope and healing. The child part of us that believes that security and safety is out there, even when we have not always experienced it. This is a reminder that no matter how much you might want to turn away, your light is always most ignited and hopeful when you turn towards. When you step into your vulnerability and surrender. I know life can get heavy at times. I know unhealed parts can get re-wounded over and over again and make us doubt in a life safer than this doubt in people who care. We see our patterns and find ourselves declaring this always happens. We carry all of our hurt with us year after year, and too often, do not do anything with it other than avoid and burry it. That contributes to an outer shell that has to protect itself by turning its back on everyone. That gets us nowhere. Pay attention to that child. Do not abandon yourself. Do not avoid yourself. Stop sending yourself the message that your story does not matter, and that your hurt and pain can not be healed. It can. But it takes your attention. It takes your commitment. It takes deliberate time to look inwardly and hold your inner child tight. Be the person you needed when you were younger.'},\n",

It is a lack of self awareness that keeps us from being greater greater friends, siblings, employees, bosses, partners etc. The lack of self awareness gives us permission to not do things differently. Read that again. The lack of self awareness gives us permission to stay the same. Because if we know better .we have to do better. Maya Angelou really got that one right. So when we avoid self awareness we are really sending ourselves and others the message that we are unwilling or just not ready to create change. How does that feel? What is getting in the way? What are the constraints? What fears are on the other side of your self awareness? You have to be ready to get real with yourself. To think about what is waiting to be understood and why we are not willing to go there. Change demands so much from us. It demands that we elevate ourselves. It demands that we elevate those around us. It demands that we look at our patterns and our wounds, and find ways to love the easily unlovable parts.

Maybe you are feeling less connected maybe things just do not feel the same anymore maybe she stays out after work a little bit longer, or he uses three words to answer how was your day? Maybe your sex life has changed, and priorities have shifted. Whatever it is when something feels off you need to pay attention to it. Something is shifting some dynamic is changing. Sometimes it is you and sometimes it is the other person, but what is most important is that a message is being sent without using words to communicate something. Too often we let the feeling sit and fester for way too long. We know something is up, but instead of voicing our concerns, we internalize what we are feeling and then act out in some way. When something feels off we need to learn to communicate that. We need to have the courage to speak up and and share. We need to ask questions. We need to make ourselves and the relationship a priority. We avoid instead of turning towards. Maybe we are afraid the other person will not listen maybe we expect them to dismiss and reject what it is we are saying but honoring ourselves enough to share ourselves is so valuable. There is always a message that is trying to be communicated. When something feels off, it is because we are not understanding that message. People do not always know how to put that message into words and therein lies the challenge. Look, we may not be perfect at it, but I encourage you to start somewhere. Try to put words to your message, before your behavior leads you down a road that is harder to come back from. When something feels off talk about it.

We convince ourselves that it is enough or that it is at least better than nothing. We shrink our needs and abandon ourselves by standing by and doing nothing about it. I can sit here and tell all of you that you are all enough that you are worthy of great love. That you belong and have the right to be understood.

What are your belief systems and narratives around love and relationships? What did you see and experience growing up, or in past intimate relationships, and how did that influence your self worth? Maybe a parent was unfaithful and destroyed your image of long lasting love. It was never spoken about and you saw them stay in an unfulfilling marriage. You took away a message that love does not last, or this is what love is maybe it is okay or expected to have low expectations and not need want more. Maybe you have been shamed for being single for too long you seem so great though I just do not understand?!? Perplexed family members, friends, and sometimes strangers do not realize that shaming being single can influence a decision to step into stay in an unheathy relationship. Something is better than nothing, right?! Or maybe you were the youngest in your family and every time you tried to share how you felt, you were overlooked and never heard. You are just the baby what do you know? And so, voicing fears and concerns or just simple requests and emotional needs feels off the table.

Let them have adventures in the wild without you Let them face their fears, let them crash and burn, let them rise up. And know, deep down, that heroes are not qualified by their capacity to stay but by their decision to return. Isa Garcia The way a person leaves reveals so much. Yes, we know on some level they have to and maybe even that it is the right thing but the way in which they do it reflects their level of functioning. Does the person communicate clearly, do they shut down and just disappear, do they place all the blame on you, are they stepping into something new that elevates them, or going back to something that keeps them playing small? Are they inconsiderate, disrespectful, mean, shut down, or defensive, or are they kind, calm, honest, and willing to take ownership for where they are right now? We can not keep a person from leaving that is not our job, but we can learn a lot about a person by the way in which they do it and similarly we can learn a lot about ourselves. Most people prefer clear closure. People have a yearning to understand. We want to make sense of things. We believe that if we can understand, then we can be released. Unfortunately, some people leave and they do not or can not give us the clarity we seek. They do not provide answers. They do not help us understand. What I say to that? We have all of the answers we seek from others within us. We have all of the closure we could ever need if we just allow ourselves to go there if we are willing to admit what it is we have been denying or convincing ourselves out of.

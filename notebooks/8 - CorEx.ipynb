It is quite hard to be self reflective and introspective when we are defending ourselves and hurting. It is also hard to understand ourselves when we have avoidant and invulnerable. Every which way, there are times when we can not see the message or lesson in front of us, and other times when we just do not want to. That is why the people who lean into us even when we are leaning away from ourselves are some of the most beautiful souls to ever walk into our lives. These people make us a priority. They make growth, transformation, and healing a priority. These people look out for us and say if you can not love yourself through it I will. No, they are not responsible for us, but loving relationships swoop in from time to time to offer us what it is we can not always give ourselves. I can not tell you how many times I have thought I understood myself to only realize with a gentle nudge from a trusted individual that there is more for me to see. I have such a deep appreciation for whenever this happens. Whether it is my partner, friend, or family member, their commitment to lovingly learning about me is not only transformative, it is connective and deepens trust. Who are your people?

Here is the deal: to be human is to recognize that you are occupied by a wolf of love and a wolf of hate. That you are capable of: BOTH generosity AND greed BOTH kindness AND hurt BOTH equanimity AND reactivity BOTH grace AND judgment This is your nature. It is mine as well. We become dangerous emotionally, spiritually, physically when we act as if we do not have capacity for harm. As if the world is made up of us and them. We are far safer when we can sit with the discomfort of knowing we have a shadow. It is ours to manage. Now more than ever, we must be actively cultivating practices that feed the wolf of love. Practices at the level of: the individual the couple the family the community A relational self-awareness exercise is to make a list of things you do or could do to feed your wolf of love each day. Individual practices may include breathing practices, music, movement, and being discerning about the media you consume. Couple practices may include letting your partner know each day that you appreciate and cherish them. Family practices may include rituals like family walks or meals and letting them know that you cherish their presence in your life. Community practices may include activism that moves us toward deeper understanding and equality. May we expand our capacity for compassion so that our wolves of love can guide us. I want to name the complexity of a white woman sharing a story told by a white man about a Native American woman. In some ways it is wholly unsurprising that this wisdom comes from a culture that was founded in collectivism not individualism colonization capitalism. Most wisdom does',\n",

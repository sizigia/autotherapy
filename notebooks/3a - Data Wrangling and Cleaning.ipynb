It is not easy to make change, but there is a beautiful and fulfilling life out there with incredible relationships, and hell yea love, waiting for you.

It is hard to understand when someone was once a huge part of our lives that they no longer play the same role. Sometimes we outgrow the people we never thought we would; sometimes life takes us in different directions. It is never a simple process, but releasing people is the most generous gift you can give them and yourself. Eventually, you will start to see that you no longer need to be sad, you no longer need to feel it as a loss. Eventually, you will see it as a part of your story that has gotten you to where you are now. You will think fondly on the challenge and growth. You will say thank you for being redirected, and for it leading you to your next chapter. Sometimes the space between two people is too great for a reason. Stop trying to control the process. Release yourself from the outcome. When you do, great things will begin to come your way.',\n",

We question why we haven\\'t met \"the one\" or why we didn\\'t land the job? We often try so hard to rush the process because we are attached to an outcome instead of slowing down to gain the wisdom and growth that are a part of the journey. \\nSomeone tells us they need time...time to figure themselves out, and two weeks later we wonder why they don\\'t have all of the answers. Remember to be patient with yourself and patient with others. This is different than just waiting. You do not need to put your life on hold, but you do need to remind yourself to be patient...To not allow your expectations and need to be in control of the process get in the way of allowing the growth to happen naturally. Patience is a beautiful thing when you navigate it properly. It\\'s not just that good things come to those who wait.

His wisdom and words are important to share so please check him out Now to add my thoughts to his original post We all need to be reminded that life does not just go according to our plan. We question why we have not met the one or why we did not land the job? We often try so hard to rush the process because we are attached to an outcome instead of slowing down to gain the wisdom and growth that are a part of the journey. Someone tells us they need time time to figure themselves out, and two weeks later we wonder why they do not have all of the answers. Remember to be patient with yourself and patient with others. This is different than just waiting. You do not need to put your life on hold, but you do need to remind yourself to be patient To not allow your expectations and need to be in control of the process get in the way of allowing the growth to happen naturally. Patience is a beautiful thing when you navigate it properly. It is not just that good things come to those who wait. It is that good things come to those who learn and grow while they wait.',\n",

We are convinced that safety is when we are in control if things are done our way then they are done correctly If we manipulate someone into staying with us, we have won if we are controlling a certain outcome then we have been victorious. If you are controlling a relationship you are always losing. Yup, I said it. And, I will repeat it. If you are controlling a relationship or another person you are losing even if the outcome you want is happening. Because love is not about control. Love is freedom.',\n",

We believe it is the absence of being okay. Our truest happy moments do not just fall on our lap.

If we are doing life the right way , we are growing, we are challenging messages received, we are being called to higher levels of functioning, and we are calling those around us, too. Many friends can be right there with us growing at similar levels, challenging us, demanding we challenge them, but sometimes we outgrow friends ouch, right? Sounds cruel, but in the same way as some romantic partners can only go so far with us, so too can friends even ones that were once besties . Sometimes friends can only call us so far, sometimes they stop serving a positive purpose in our lives and actually keep us stuck in patterns we are trying to break free from.

You should absolutely be growing and bettering yourself at all times...but you should never be muting yourself because you think it\\'s the only way someone will like and accept you. **newsflash** you will never be too much or too little of something for the person who can\\'t get enough of exactly who you are. That strong mind of yours is going to match up so perfectly with someone who can\\'t wait to get their hands on it...who wants to learn it, and challenge it, and understand every detail of it. That eagerness of yours is going to be so welcomed by the person who can embrace it with open arms and match it. \\nYou never ever have to be something you are not. In fact, doing that will actually get you further away from the person who can\\'t get enough of who you are. Have something to say, say it.

Do not be too eager, play the game a woman can not think you are too into her. This is all crap. You should absolutely be growing and bettering yourself at all times but you should never be muting yourself because you think it is the only way someone will like and accept you. newsflash you will never be too much or too little of something for the person who can not get enough of exactly who you are. That strong mind of yours is going to match up so perfectly with someone who can not wait to get their hands on it who wants to learn it, and challenge it, and understand every detail of it. That eagerness of yours is going to be so welcomed by the person who can embrace it with open arms and match it. You never ever have to be something you are not.

       "  'content': '**READ THIS PLEASE: I was having a conversation with a friend about this recently, and discussing the declaration said round the world \"I\\'ll never meet someone like him/her again.\" Something uttered at the end of relationships at a rate of 100% 😉 (I\\'m sort of kidding...but I bet that we\\'ve at least said that once or twice in our lives.) So a couple of things. When we\\'re at the end of a relationship we are generally emotionally flooded. That means the feelings are cray. Bouncing all over. We may have moments of clarity, anger, sadness, avoidance, despair, on and on. Our narrative of \"never finding the right person\" can get triggered...on top of \"everyone always leaves me\", \"I\\'m going to be single forever\", \"I\\'m not good enough for anyone.\" First, all of those are crap. You are your second enemy...your first is anyone who ever sent you that message to begin with. But guess what...they\\'re not responsible for your thoughts, so it\\'s up to you to tell your mind to lovingly #stfu and start replacing it with something positive and strength based. \\nThe second piece here is maybe even more important and helpful. There are parts of a person we might always love. There *are* people who come into our lives and show us a different type of love. They are the crease in our story, and it\\'s why we so often say that we\\'ll never find someone quite like that person....well, because we never have before, and it\\'s taken so long to find him or her. But what we need to understand is that our love story is one that does take and search for the greatest parts of all of our past partners, and then search for *those* parts again in everyone we meet. But it doesn\\'t end there...because that\\'s where we ask more of the next. We ask them to be ready...to show up. Because no matter how wonderful or incredible the last was...they weren\\'t enough...not for you. So don\\'t be afraid of looking for all those amazing parts in people...how wonderful to have had a relationship that has imprinted on you in such a way that you look for so many parts of it again. It\\'s like a prerequisite...\"you must have these parts\"...and then more. #mindfulmft\\n',\n",

       "  'pre_cleaned_text': 'READ THIS PLEASE: I was having a conversation with a friend about this recently, and discussing the declaration said round the world I will never meet someone like him her again. Something uttered at the end of relationships at a rate of 100 I am sort of kidding but I bet that we have at least said that once or twice in our lives. So a couple of things. When we are at the end of a relationship we are generally emotionally flooded. That means the feelings are cray. Bouncing all over. We may have moments of clarity, anger, sadness, avoidance, despair, on and on. Our narrative of never finding the right person can get triggered on top of everyone always leaves me , I am going to be single forever , I am not good enough for anyone. First, all of those are crap. You are your second enemy your first is anyone who ever sent you that message to begin with. But guess what they are not responsible for your thoughts, so it is up to you to tell your mind to lovingly and start replacing it with something positive and strength based. The second piece here is maybe even more important and helpful. There are parts of a person we might always love. There are people who come into our lives and show us a different type of love. They are the crease in our story, and it is why we so often say that we will never find someone quite like that person .well, because we never have before, and it is taken so long to find him or her. But what we need to understand is that our love story is one that does take and search for the greatest parts of all of our past partners, and then search for those parts again in everyone we meet. But it does not end there because that is where we ask more of the next. We ask them to be ready to show up. Because no matter how wonderful or incredible the last was they were not enough not for you. So do not be afraid of looking for all those amazing parts in people how wonderful to have had a relationship that has imprinted on you in such a way that you look for so many parts of it again. It is like a prerequisite you must have these parts and then more.',\n",

It is expensive yes. But it is an investment in yourself. Seriously, maybe it is insane to spend that type of money when you have never done it before, when you have never honored your worth but, this is not a handbag, or a piece of jewelry, it is not even just a vacation this is money that is being spent on you and your future relationships. This is money spent on a future of happiness. This is money spent on not staying stuck, and stepping into your greatest way of living. Have the courage today to choose yourself. Have the courage to push the doubt and fears aside. And have the courage to say you are worth it. You are. Your relationships are and we are waiting for you. Link in bio',\n",

We are fairly tired of the idea of meeting at a bar, we rarely believe in just bumping into each other on a street randomly, and we are collectively tired of the oooh I know someone great for you scenario. Know why??? Because none of that has anything to do with you doing the things you love and sharing a space with other people who happen to also love the things you love because they love them too and are not compromising sacrificing or faking it. When we start doing the things we love, we start living for our love and passion. We start honoring ourselves instead of minimizing ourselves. We begin sending beautiful messages of loving your life instead of needing to be loved. That is just damn attractive .right? Doing what you love. Being inspired and then inspiring. Being happy. I am not sure it gets better. So let is start going to classes where you want to learn something new that you are interested in go to conferences about things that ignite your soul, travel to places, join a team, running group, improv class ORRRRR come to my retreat for singles in Cali where you will meet like minded people Link in bio!',\n",

It is not time that heals it is what we DO with our time that makes the difference. We HAVE to become better. Every day. That is what makes things seem easier. Is not that fascinating?? Seriously life does not get easier we just get better at managing our emotions, we get better at honoring ourselves, we get better at saying goodbye to things or people that no longer serve us, we get better at going after what we want and living with purpose instead of from fear.

We can interpret it in many ways, but one thing is for sure, negative narratives will always keep us stuck. I am not backing down from inner narratives and message. What we say to ourselves, what we say out loud it all represents a belief system. It is how we feel about ourselves, it is what we think others think and feel about us, it is what we have been told or the way we have interpreted experiences. We have to be careful with our self talk. It is from that space that we choose. What do you hear yourself say? What messages do you keep about yourself? Are they mostly negative or positive? Are you owned by your self talk? Does it put you down, keep you from your dreams, make you question your worth, purpose, and ability to be loved and understood? Or, are you aware and in control of your narratives and messages? Do you understand how your story has impacted you? Do you challenge the messages received, and subscribe to new, positive ones that allow you to grow, thrive, and succeed? You are only damned if you believe yourself to be You are what you think with that, I can not imagine a better time to start to clean up your thoughts.',\n",

So often we waltz through life without a deeper understanding of whether we are being led by fear or led by joy and happiness. This has so much to do with where we wind up, and how quickly we get there. We want to be led by conscious choosing to be able to say I choose this because and to feel confident and good about whatever that blank space holds. Understanding our fear is crucial. Without it we walk blindly through life. We let fears choose for us keep us from our greater selves.

It is in that space that we are able to rest assured that even though other things may not be perfect, we are safe here with them. Set out to be the bridge. Work towards creating safety and security for others. Be the open arms. Be the break. Send beautiful messages. Be thoughtful. And kind. Compassionate and considerate. Be the positive thoughts for others.',\n",

We try so hard to control things Sometimes it is to take care of our insecurities, and other times it is because we see the beautiful potential in others. But the truth is that another person is most beautiful transformation comes when it unfolds through freedom not because we have forced it on them, or because we think that the orange needs to be softened on the right. It happens because when we love a person enough to allow them freedom, we give them the potential to own their transformation for themselves. People are just as wonderful as sunsets, but far too often we jump in prematurely trying to fix things , manipulate, and control we do not allow ourselves to watch in awe and embrace a person walking through life and unfolding new parts of themselves Let people be as beautiful as sunsets. Let them peel back their layers. Let them transform. Contribute and challenge, but watch in awe as they take ownership for their own lives and growth.',\n",

We celebrate fathers on this day and give so many thanks for the lessons, the love, and the beautiful commitment you have made to being the best you can be THANK YOU Not everyone has had the privilege of having, or knowing, a great father. So, I would like to take some time to acknowledge that this day is to celebrate men. Any men that have showed up in our lives and have been there have loved us have been a listening ear. This is a day when we honor men who may not be fathers yet, but are on a path to challenging themselves every day to be better, kinder, and more self aware THANK YOU There are great men all around us. If we are lucky the best one is our dad, but feel free to look around see your brother, uncle, best friend see your colleague, teammate, partner, husband look around and find the beauty and courage in the men around you. I love knowing that I am living amongst men who are not just committing to being better each day, but that their purpose in life is to help grow and inspire men around them. There are many many! of you, but today I honor and . Thank you for being great men thank you for inspiring others, and thank you for your commitment to improving men each and every day And to my dad major major! love for the growth opportunities accompanied by love every day. You may never pull over to stop for directions but you have nailed a lot of the rest of the stuff.',\n",

If our narrative about ourselves is that we are not lovable, or special, or important then it is easier to accept less than what we deserve. It has to start with you. The way you show up for yourself shows people what is acceptable and what is not. There is no room for negotiation when your sense of self is strong when your sense of self is rooted in your beautiful truth.

       "  'content': 'Forgiveness can be such a challenge. When we think about forgiveness we often think about it as it pertains to others. \"How can I forgive this person for wronging me in this way?\" We play with the idea of forgiving but not forgetting. \"Does it mean that what they did was okay?\" \"I\\'m hurt so badly. Will I ever get over it? Should I?\" We ask these questions often without conclusion. There are answers...but today I\\'d like to shift our focus and talk about forgiving ourselves. \\nLike others, we screw up. We let ourselves down. We say nasty things to ourselves, and can often be our own worst critic. Maybe we self harmed, maybe we watched as our sibling or parent got abused, maybe we didn\\'t stand up for our friend, or we\\'ve lived a selfish life where we have put ourselves first at the expense of others. Maybe we\\'ve been mean, and rude, and used drugs or alcohol or sex to cope with things. Maybe we\\'ve gambled away our savings, or abandoned a child...a partner...ourselves. \\nWe are human. We screw up...sometimes badly. But forgiving ourselves is a must. More often than not, we\\'re just as frustrated and hurt with ourselves than anyone else. Yet we avoid processing the anger and hurt that we carry around. Maybe we\\'re angry with ourselves for \"letting\" our sister get hit...we question why it wasn\\'t us...and then wish we could go back and protect her from it. Or, we have such disgust for ourselves after spending all of our savings...and are ashamed and embarrassed that we can\\'t buy our children the things they want. \\nBefore we do anything, we must give ourselves *permission* to forgive ourselves. It doesn\\'t mean that what we\\'ve done is okay...it just means that we accept that we are human and didn\\'t know how to handle that time any differently. We must be gentler with ourselves. Forgive for not knowing better, and then grow. Grow from that space. Commit to being better. Commit to handling things differently. Remind yourself that you\\'re not re-entering that old space, but rather stepping into something new. You deserve forgiveness. You are human and you are imperfect.  #mindfulmft\\n',\n",

       "  'pre_cleaned_text': 'Forgiveness can be such a challenge. When we think about forgiveness we often think about it as it pertains to others. How can I forgive this person for wronging me in this way? We play with the idea of forgiving but not forgetting. Does it mean that what they did was okay? I am hurt so badly. Will I ever get over it? Should I? We ask these questions often without conclusion. There are answers but today I would like to shift our focus and talk about forgiving ourselves. Like others, we screw up. We let ourselves down. We say nasty things to ourselves, and can often be our own worst critic. Maybe we self harmed, maybe we watched as our sibling or parent got abused, maybe we did not stand up for our friend, or we have lived a selfish life where we have put ourselves first at the expense of others. Maybe we have been mean, and rude, and used drugs or alcohol or sex to cope with things. Maybe we have gambled away our savings, or abandoned a child a partner ourselves. We are human. We screw up sometimes badly. But forgiving ourselves is a must. More often than not, we are just as frustrated and hurt with ourselves than anyone else. Yet we avoid processing the anger and hurt that we carry around. Maybe we are angry with ourselves for letting our sister get hit we question why it was not us and then wish we could go back and protect her from it. Or, we have such disgust for ourselves after spending all of our savings and are ashamed and embarrassed that we can not buy our children the things they want. Before we do anything, we must give ourselves permission to forgive ourselves. It does not mean that what we have done is okay it just means that we accept that we are human and did not know how to handle that time any differently. We must be gentler with ourselves. Forgive for not knowing better, and then grow. Grow from that space. Commit to being better. Commit to handling things differently. Remind yourself that you are not re-entering that old space, but rather stepping into something new. You deserve forgiveness. You are human and you are imperfect.',\n",

So think about what your narratives are surrounding the different roles you play. Are there any parts of your life that feel like they are lagging a bit? Consider exploring the narratives around that role, and see if maybe you need a little extra self love in that space.',\n",

We fear revealing ourselves so instead, we work hard at hiding. We hide what it is we think others will judge. We hide what it is we believe is less than, and we build relationships off of a foundation that is not entirely true. Not everyone is going to like and accept all of you. That is okay. It can certainly be painful at times, but there are people who can and will. The problem is when we live our entire lives guarded and fearful. You see, when we do that we give NO ONE the opportunity to learn us and love us as we truly are. We pretend to be someone we are not in order to have a false sense of love and belonging. We convince ourselves that a lifetime of that is greater than staying true to ourselves for an opportunity to belong and be loved by a few people for exactly who we are. Our priorities are wrong. There is nothing better than being loved and accepted in our truest most authentic form. Nothing competes with that. So have the courage to reveal yourself. Be vulnerable. Do not let your fears lead you and get in the way of your most beautiful relationships. Give yourself the opportunity to be accepted for all of the things you have worked so hard at hiding. Your rawness is the key to your core desires.',\n",

       "  'pre_cleaned_text': 'Coming to our purpose is one of the most important moments in our lives. Some might say it is number one. It is a game changer. Clear purpose fills us up. We finally put the excuses and fears aside, and prioritize our best self. We look inwardly and ask what it is we can create we identify what it is we want to celebrate over and over again each day. It is not that everything goes perfectly when we have found purpose it is just that we accept and know that we are exactly where we need to be and in that space, the challenges are fuel they inspire and we embrace. We do not fight it. We do not complain too often because our purpose is too clear too great. We really have to like ourselves to get anything done in this world. I posted that quote not too long ago. There is so much truth there. We need to really love our purpose. It is what will trickle down and impact every other part of our lives. It will change our relationships with others and with ourselves. Clear purpose creates a joy within us. It gives us a role it gives us an identity with which we are able to positively connect. Purpose is what our partners are able to desire in us most. Our desire for one another can be at its greatest when we see our person doing what it is they love and owning it. So if your purpose is not clear, search for it discover it now. It is never too late. Do not allow anything to get in your way. If nothing mattered except your joy, what would you be doing? Do that and then share it with the world.',\n",

Over time, we come to believe and understand that how we feel does not matter no one listens anyway..or that we are not important or loved enough to be heard. Maybe we are supposed to be quiet maybe we were part of a family system that did not value our thoughts maybe no one ever asked maybe keeping the peace within an already chaotic family system meant staying quiet maybe men are not supposed to have emotions or as a woman you have been criticized for your emotions being too emotional needy crazy. The list can go on and on. It is important to understand what it is that actually keeps us from sharing what is really going on? Think about that. When you feel something, what do you say to yourself that stops you from sharing it. Identify that first. Now let is try to understand why? What is happened that is supported that fear? Maybe it is past experiences with that person? Maybe it is messages you received growing up from family society? You see, the problem with saying I am fine when we are actually feeling something else is that we send ourselves the message that we are not important enough to challenge the narrative that is keeping us quiet. It is like we have accepted the narratives as truth or we have accepted our role as one that we are stuck in for life. We stop fighting for it to be different. We begin to believe there is no use anyway. We are all important enough to challenge those narratives. We have the capacity to choose differently.

Sure, maybe we would be able to go further in our journey with that person but the fact that they can not or will not choose us makes them undoubtedly mediocre love. They can still be great love for someone else for another post . Great love is ready. But instead of focusing all of our energy on the other person, let is take a moment to consider that if we are attracting mediocre love that we may still have certain growth areas that need improving before we are able to give and receive great love. Do not confuse your desire for a relationship for your ability to gift great love. So often we declare I am ready! We believe that we are great love when we are not. Ouch. I know. But, put down the defenses for a minute. Allow the love you receive to be some type of reflection for a moment. Maybe it is the love you are actually giving or maybe it is as much as you actually believes you are worthy of. Consider what is keeping you from great love? Challenge the areas that need attention in order to get closer to it. Great love does find great love. Great love chooses great love and it is within reach for all of us. Sometimes we have to dig in and take a closer look at ourselves in order to get it.',\n",

Let them have adventures in the wild without you Let them face their fears, let them crash and burn, let them rise up. And know, deep down, that heroes are not qualified by their capacity to stay but by their decision to return. The way a person leaves reveals so much. Yes, we know on some level they have to and maybe even that it is the right thing but the way in which they do it reflects their level of functioning. Does the person communicate clearly, do they shut down and just disappear, do they place all the blame on you, are they stepping into something new that elevates them, or going back to something that keeps them playing small? Are they inconsiderate, disrespectful, mean, shut down, or defensive, or are they kind, calm, honest, and willing to take ownership for where they are right now? We can not keep a person from leaving that is not our job, but we can learn a lot about a person by the way in which they do it and similarly we can learn a lot about ourselves. Most people prefer clear closure. People have a yearning to understand. We want to make sense of things. We believe that if we can understand, then we can be released. Unfortunately, some people leave and they do not or can not give us the clarity we seek. They do not provide answers. They do not help us understand. What I say to that? We have all of the answers we seek from others within us. We have all of the closure we could ever need if we just allow ourselves to go there if we are willing to admit what it is we have been denying or convincing ourselves out of. I promise we have all of the answers we need as long as we give ourselves permission to go there. Your closure is on the other side of your comfort zone.',\n",

Second chances can be the most beautiful decision we\\'ve ever made. And saying 🙅🏽 (hell no) might be a response we never (ever) change or reconsider. \\nI\\'d like to offer two things to consider in helping decide what decision makes the most sense for you. When someone tries to re-enter your life, make sure you understand the growth they\\'ve achieved while they were away. If you\\'re going to let someone back in, they should be able to clearly explain how they\\'ve grown, and what areas they know will be different...they need awareness...otherwise, it\\'s likely that you\\'ll create the same patterns that led to that ending in the first place. \\nSecondly, ask yourself what\\'s driving your decision? For example, do you want to say yes because you\\'ve clearly understood their growth, or is it because you\\'re tired of being alone? Make sure your motivating force is clean. And consider what it will be like if it ends for the second time. Can you be at peace with that? Is it okay for this person to re-enter and only take you a little bit further in your journey? \\nSometimes our answers are through trial and error, but if people want to re-enter without doing any work, it\\'s likely a decision that will create the same outcome as before. \\nDon\\'t show up for mediocre love. Open yourself up to greater love. Sometimes that\\'s from a former lover...and sometimes that\\'s someone else out there in this big, grand world. #mindfulmft\\n',\n",

We seem to question whether it is okay to let people back in, or if we should just commit to when something is over it is over. There is not a one way fits all answer here. Second chances can be the most beautiful decision we have ever made. And saying hell no might be a response we never ever change or reconsider. I would like to offer two things to consider in helping decide what decision makes the most sense for you. When someone tries to re-enter your life, make sure you understand the growth they have achieved while they were away. If you are going to let someone back in, they should be able to clearly explain how they have grown, and what areas they know will be different they need awareness otherwise, it is likely that you will create the same patterns that led to that ending in the first place. Secondly, ask yourself what is driving your decision? For example, do you want to say yes because you have clearly understood their growth, or is it because you are tired of being alone? Make sure your motivating force is clean. And consider what it will be like if it ends for the second time. Can you be at peace with that? Is it okay for this person to re-enter and only take you a little bit further in your journey? Sometimes our answers are through trial and error, but if people want to re-enter without doing any work, it is likely a decision that will create the same outcome as before. Do not show up for mediocre love. Open yourself up to greater love. Sometimes that is from a former lover and sometimes that is someone else out there in this big, grand world.',\n",

We need to believe that we can change the things that keep us stuck. We need to believe in others' ability to do the same. We need to believe that we have the capacity to heal. We need to believe that hurt drives hurt, and if we can just understand that hurt will become healing. Please continue to persist. Please hold hope. Hope in yourself. Hope that great things come on the other side of hurt and pain if you put the energy in. Please believe that you are capable of owning your parts and that they do not have to own you. Please believe that you are not defined by your story. Please believe that your patterns are only your patterns until you change them and make them new. We are such an incredible species.

Truth is, we need to prioritize each other every day. Even if it is for a short amount of time. We need to send the message that you matter to me repeatedly. That never gets old. The small things we do every day are more important then the big things we do once in awhile. Never stop learning about your partner. Never lose your curiosity. Open yourself up and share something new and invite your partner to do the same. Continue to be a student of your relationship, and commit to growth every day. Author of meme unknown.',\n",

It is Mark from helping Vienna out as she marinates in sunshine somewhere on the globe. and I will be mixing it up on here and rapping about love, relationships And whatever else sneaks in there. This quote resonates so much with me. In a past relationship I was asked, If she left you tomorrow would you be ok? And I would have And giving that answer sucked. It meant I was loving small and not vulnerable at all. On top of that I was so afraid to leave a relationship I did not even want to be in, that my fear had now removed her ability to find someone who would die to have her forever She deserved that. And more selfishly, so did I. Fear of hurting someone is feelings and being worried about what the world thought of me caused my choices to misalign two souls that should have been elsewhere. Now, we can all argue about how I needed to go through this to know that, and that is very true. However, I knew the answer, but fear and ego prevented me from listening to it. We already have all the answers inside us. We already have an idea of what we want and where our hearts lean. Do not let the selfishness that has you playing safe disrupt and take away the right someone else has to deep love. And in the end you are just preventing yourself from finding it too.',\n",

At our core, we all just want to be understood. We want to feel safe there, and trust that no matter what we share, our person is going to be able hear it and understand it. That they will not try to fix it, dismiss it, reject it, or avoid it. If ever security is lacking, try listening really try listening. Try understanding. Step away from solving it. Step away from refuting it, or pushing back on it. People do not need to avoid their emotions, they need them to be understood.',\n",

The I can not get enough of you. Gosh it feels so good. We are good at that. It is easy to be in love. It is easy to feel those feelings. It does not demand much of us. It is not hard work. But loving that is a different story. Loving someone takes deliberate work. That part is not as easy. It is choosing to show up. It is choosing to communicate. It is choosing kindness and appreciation gratitude and generosity. It is choosing honoring each other. It is choosing balancing autonomy and togetherness and building a shared future together. It takes talking when we are upset, and finding the right ways to honor our hurt. It takes listening to understand instead of listening to respond. It takes stepping away from criticism, defensiveness, contempt or just shutting down. Loving someone takes work. It takes challenging ourselves beyond what it is we know to be humanly possible at times. Loving someone takes work. It takes rewriting narratives and embracing that maybe we do not have it all figured it out. It takes hearing each other and not needing to be right all of the time. Being in love is beautiful. But that part is easy. Loving .that is where the reeeaaalllyy good stuff is. Because when we are still loved through the hard stuff when we are loved because someone wants to put in the work with us it changes it all.',\n",

Often times in relationships the things we criticize and complain about the most are reflections of our own self. I tell clients to think about a complaint that they have of their partner, and then to put a mirror in front of themselves and ask how well they do what it is they are complaining about. Now wait, do not get caught up in the content. You may say he does not put the toilet seat down .I always do..that is not a reflection of me , so before we get lost in that, try to understand the hurt, wound, or meaning taken from the complaint. Maybe you do not feel important, or listened to? Maybe you feel like he does not care? Maybe you feel like you do not have a voice? Connect to the hurt instead of the complaint. Once you do that, then ask yourself how well you show up in that area. Do you make your partner feel important, heard, and like he has a voice? I bet there is room for growth there. So slow down, and gain awareness and understanding of yourself and your reactions. How you respond says a whole lot more about your emotional understanding of yourself and your partner.

We all have fears, but what you do with them says a lot about your growth and what it is you are embracing. Operating from a fear based place allows us to take the easy way out. That is different than saying the choice is easy. What I mean is that when we accept that the fear and it is discomfort is greater than our desire for something we know we actually want and deserve, we succumb to a path of least resistance. Choosing the path of least resistance may save you from something in the moment, but it perpetuates your pattern and does not ever lead you to where you ultimately want to arrive. So if you are ready to arrive see below : Understand your fear. You need to deconstruct that thing to its bones. You need to understand the meaning around it. Why do you fear it? Is it what others will think about you? What society says? What message is attached to the fear? Should you feel shame or embarrassment? When we choose the fear, we wind up trying to save our ego. We wind up saying it is too uncomfortable for me to let other people see me this way, so I choose what is safe. That is NOT stepping into your greatness. That is NOT choosing the bigger picture. That is NOT choosing to show up for yourself. That is you allowing other people to dilute your day, you week, and ultimately your life. What you want needs to be greater than what you fear.

The love of your life moves across the country, but society and friends and family tell you you should not move for a girl. Why not?? Why are we not embracing the things that are trying desperately to be a part of our lives? Life is not supposed to be a certain way. Life is meant to be lived, and the best way you live is by getting real with yourself and figuring out what it is YOU believe. Embrace yourself. Live big. Life is waiting for you to put your fears and shoulds aside.'},\n",

We question why we have not met the one or why we did not land the job? We often try so hard to rush the process because we are attached to an outcome instead of slowing down to gain the wisdom and growth that are a part of the journey. Someone tells us they need time time to figure themselves out, and two weeks later we wonder why they do not have all of the answers. Remember to be patient with yourself and patient with others. This is different than just waiting. You do not need to put your life on hold, but you do need to remind yourself to be patient To not allow your expectations and need to be in control of the process get in the way of allowing the growth to happen naturally. Patience is a beautiful thing when you navigate it properly. It is not just that good things come to those who wait. It is that good things come to those who learn and grow while they wait.'},\n",

Whether people literally leave you or not, they may leave the role they once had in your life, and that is something we have to be able to accept without it destroying us. When you never see a person again, you realize they will never play the role in your life you once had room for. It is okay for you to grow, it is okay for your friends and partners to grow, and it is okay if the growth happens to change your purpose and role in each other is lives. It is a beautiful way of knowing that change is happening and space is being created for greater things.'},\n",

The boundaries we have for ourselves are a reflection of how we value ourselves and our emotional needs. How were boundaries demonstrated for you growing up? Did parents dump their problems on you looking for you to serve a role that was not developmentally appropriate? Did you have to be a caretaker? Were you depended upon in order for someone else to be okay? We have to remember that we can not fix things for other people and we can not have others fix things or us. People can be listeners, they can hear, and process, and challenge us .but they cannot fix. You cannot fix others.

Because the truth is, if someone is questioning us, it means they are questioning themselves and a person who questions themselves is not capable of full love. They are not ready for the type of the love that asks them to show up. Anyone who is not certain in their partner is not certain with themselves. So if a person is struggling between you and someone else, let them go and send the message that you are choosing yourself. If they can not , you will. So here is two things I want you to do 1. Follow if you do not already because he is one of the most inspirational men I know that lives a life that he preaches, and 2. If you are someone who is single and trying to learn more about relationships and choosing yourself PLEASE take a look at the retreat and I are leading in Cali at the end of April.

Something uttered at the end of relationships at a rate of 100 I am sort of kidding but I bet that we have at least said that once or twice in our lives. So a couple of things. When we are at the end of a relationship we are generally emotionally flooded. That means the feelings are cray. Bouncing all over. We may have moments of clarity, anger, sadness, avoidance, despair, on and on. Our narrative of never finding the right person can get triggered on top of everyone always leaves me , I am going to be single forever , I am not good enough for anyone. First, all of those are crap. You are your second enemy your first is anyone who ever sent you that message to begin with. But guess what they are not responsible for your thoughts, so it is up to you to tell your mind to lovingly and start replacing it with something positive and strength based. The second piece here is maybe even more important and helpful. There are parts of a person we might always love. There are people who come into our lives and show us a different type of love. They are the crease in our story, and it is why we so often say that we will never find someone quite like that person .well, because we never have before, and it is taken so long to find him or her. But what we need to understand is that our love story is one that does take and search for the greatest parts of all of our past partners, and then search for those parts again in everyone we meet. But it does not end there because that is where we ask more of the next. We ask them to be ready to show up. Because no matter how wonderful or incredible the last was they were not enough not for you. So do not be afraid of looking for all those amazing parts in people how wonderful to have had a relationship that has imprinted on you in such a way that you look for so many parts of it again. It is like a prerequisite you must have these parts and then more.'},\n",

Old friendships that grow with you are the greatest , but maybe it is time to shift ourselves into a space of opening up to new people stepping into a vulnerable space, and allowing connection.

There are crappy people. Period. And there are growing, mindful, self aware people. Period. Choose to dedicate yourself to the latter. No need to limit yourself or others. Do not let your past hurt keep you from opening a space for a beautiful person to walk in and write a new story. Shout out to all the great men out there!!

See how that does not work? The message we wind up sending is that our behavior, our words, and possibly the direction our life takes, are dependent upon what someone else does or says. We are saying I am not going to do my part, if you do not do yours. We choose a path that does not demand ownership because we often fear what happens if we choose to do our part and not get met in return. That is the scary part. That is exactly where the vulnerability lies. And, that is exactly where and how we get and stay stuck. That fear is legit. Let me tell you. That fear makes a lot of sense. It is pretty awful to put yourself out there and not get something back in return, but the truth is, we need to shift its purpose. If we are doing that being vulnerable in order to achieve a specific outcome, we are going to have some trouble with that. Our fears will get in the way. We will stay stuck. BUT, if we choose to put ourselves out there go after what you want, ask for what you need, do your part etc for the purpose of honoring yourself, then you will always win .even if the outcome is not the desired one.

Say you decide to go out after work to meet up with some friends instead of going home and spending time with your partner. You call to let your partner know, they kind of tell you that they would prefer you to come home, but you decide it should not be such a big deal to go grab one so you will be home in a couple of hours.

We need to understand what message was delivered to our partner when we decided to go hang out with our friends. Did we just send the message that those friends are more important than our partner? That we value them more? that is probably not the message you were trying to send, but it might be the one that got delivered .and without conversation and clarifying messages, we wind up hurt and distanced from one another. This is just an example we could use thousands of other ones, but that is why understanding and knowing the details of our partner can help us be alert to situations that could be experienced differently. When we have greater awareness, we have the option of being more delicate with the messages that we know our partner can sometimes struggle with.

But because we arrive at our anger so quickly, we often miss what the actual hurt and emotion is. Maybe you are disappointed? Maybe you feel betrayed?

If we find ourselves reacting with anger, it is a great indicator that we are not actually taking care of ourselves that we are off balance, and not honoring the primary emotion that needs attention. When all we identify is anger, frustration, or annoyance, we do an incredible disservice to ourselves and the person with whom we are trying to share the emotion.

Ever find yourself question if your partner loves you ever hear them say but I do!! I show you all the time! .and there you sit, like really?! I do not see it. I do not feel it. It is because we speak different love languages. Research identifies 5 of them: gift giving, words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, and physical touch. The ways in which we feel most loved are also usually the way we demonstrate it the most. That means, if we feel loved the most by spending quality time with someone, we are going to show our love to someone else by you guessed it spending quality time with them. Sounds great, right? Except if that is not the way they receive love, it really does not matter much. Because if they feel most loved by words of affirmation and you never praise them, pay them compliments, etc .it does not matter how much quality time you spend with them..it will always fall flat.

That is nothing to be ashamed of in fact, we will do much better once we can embrace them and identify what they actually are When we do not understand, we seek partners who will recreate the same patterns we have experienced before. It is why we so often find ourselves comparing partners to parents. It is our subconscious that is attracted to the injury i know, i know hang in there because we want so badly to know from the people we love that the injury is not true Maybe we had a father who never made us feel important, who made us question whether we mattered more than his business trips, or his drinking, or his gambling and then we find ourselves choosing partners who make us question the same thing our worth. It does not have to be the same content it is just that we are left with our wound reopened, our hurt deepening, and us questioning do I even matter? When we walk into relationships blindly, we will walk into reopening our wounds over and over and over again. But what is so beautiful about relationships is that with the right people we can heal we find answers to those questions, and our hurt is safe.'},\n",

But when we use it to keep our thoughts, feelings, or truths from our partners, family, and close friends, silence becomes a betrayal of ourselves and our responsibility to those relationships. We can be so afraid of sharing our feelings with others. We stay quiet instead of expressing our concerns, wants, and emotional needs. We convince ourselves that we should not need that , or we are not deserving of it maybe the other person should just know . Maybe we just do not want to complain, or maybe it is not what a real man does . Maybe we are supposed to be the pleaser, or we are afraid of people getting upset with us or maybe it is just too soon in a new relationship to ask or need something. The list goes on and on, but at the end of the day, too often, our silence is not beautiful it is detrimental. It is our responsibility to ourselves to honor our thoughts, feelings, and needs. Silence is rarely just silence most of the time, silence is occupied by our inner chatter an internal battle with ourselves. When the messages we say to ourselves impact us and the relationships around us, when they impact our happiness, and keep us from living our greatest lives, it is our responsibility to share it. It is important. You are important. And your relationships can only grow and develop when you trust yourself and each other to communicate what matters. People desperately want to hear what is going on inside. The right people will listen and when you trust that you are enough, your silence will get heard.'},\n",

There is no one way of defining love. But one thing that must be present, is an effort to create security where fear once existed. If you have not , learn your partner is fears. Understand their family system, and what role they played in it. What messages did they receive growing up? What were they told about themselves?

We want the promise of forever, yet we create prisons for ourselves and others and then wonder why it is we or they try to escape the relationship. Love should not be a prison but so often that is exactly what it turns into. What controls us and contains us is exactly what it is we so often try to flee from. If the walls are coming in, we will use every ounce of energy to push them out. The greatest love gives freedom. Freedom to be ourselves, freedom to choose, freedom to heal, freedom to express ourselves and be heard, freedom to ask for and get our needs met When we enter into a relationship our hope is that our partner is not going to recreate the hurt and injuries that we have experienced before. We enter in with an expectation to be free of that pain and then right there right there in our relationship we start to feel everything we have tried to escape our entire lives : unheard, lonely, unimportant, abandoned, isolated, disregarded etc. If we are not doing our part as a partner to create safety in the relationship i.e. we do not make our partner feel heard, important, listened to, appreciated, WHATEVER their injuries call for they will likely feel trapped and want to escape. Problem is we do not know how to always identify and communicate our hurt. So escaping prison does not mean honoring ourselves and communicating our hurt and needs appropriately. It shows up as divorce, cheating, escaping to alcohol, drugs, gambling, shopping, food it shows up as shutting down, sharing less, and pulling away. Do not be a prisoner to yourself. You must have the courage to share your hurt and ask for what you need and as a partner you must be attuned to what messages you are sending to your partner. Do they feel free? Or are they trapped in injuries? Now might be the time to ask before one or both of you wants to escape. Inspiration from the lovely'},\n",

We like knowing that if we do 'X', 'Y' will happen. We want certainty, and we want to know that if we work hard, practice more, stay up longer, put in the hours, read up, and apply we will have success. Sounds lovely yet somehow that does not always apply to relationships. We can give all of ourselves and do everything right , and it still will not be our choice if someone stays or goes. We can beg, plead, promise, change, be better, more attuned, and still still it is not all our choice. There is ALWAYS someone else that is choosing with us for us grrr when we are in a relationship. That is why love can be so scary; there is no certainty. Hollllldddd on . but we took vows! yes, you did. You promised to stay together NO MATTER WHAT. Whether you subscribe to that or not, what is not spoken in that space is a vow to remain happy forever a vow that we will not emotionally leave one another. Yes, you may not divorce or exit the relationship by actually physically leaving, but you may leave emotionally. Promising happiness forever or to emotionally be engaged at all times is not possible. We can not promise that because we are human. Period. So instead of looking to control outcomes and demand promises from others demand it from yourself. You are only in control of yourself and sometimes that is even a stretch . Promise what you know you can give and then talk about the rest. Focus on being the best partner. Focus on nurturing your happiness. Focus on strengthening the Self, and maintaining your roles and identity. Love yourself. Honor yourself. Honor your partner. Show up in the best way you can and then do better tomorrow. You will encourage the same in your partner you will attract that back and if you do not , you are still prepared to choose yourself even if someone else can not . Want to learn more?

Maybe narratives surface and remind us that nobody cares , you have to handle everything on your own , they will think I am awful if I talk about this the list goes on and on, and it is exactly what keeps us from having the conversations that matter. Guess what if it is in your head it matters. If you are struggling with it it is important. But YOU have to make it important. You have to choose that what you are feeling is more important than your fears more important than your negative narratives. You are not defined by them you are defined by what you allow. Think it is wrong to say it is often lonely being a stay at home mom ? It is not I can not tell you how many mothers share that exactly and follow it up with but I do not think any other mother feels that way I feel like an awful mom saying that. and so we do not except to your therapist but that is not enough. What about not feeling like a man . Are you supposed to do it all, and not speak about how you are feeling? Because that is what men do? Everything is supposed to always be okay , or I need to keep it together, or men are not supposed to talk about feelings. Guys .you are not alone. None of you are alone. But we do not know this because we do not talk about it. Everything is hush hush. We do not have conversations about the things that go against our narratives, and that is precisely what we need to be having conversations about.

With them there is always an opportunity for growth, personal understanding and development. They challenge us in new and old ways, and if we look closely enough, they shed light on exactly what it is we need to understand about ourselves. Sometimes good, sometimes bad but it is exactly what we need. Our past partners were exactly what we were ready for it at that point in our lives. It is who WE were attracting it is who we needed to help us grow. We are the only people that get in our own way.

Most of the time when people are re-entering into our lives, it is not because of love it is not after all of this hard work, self discovery, or change it is because their ego is bruised they did not want to show up before for you, but now when you are leaving now when you can show up for someone else or someone else can show up better for you, they want back in. That, my friends, is called fear. When second chances are driven by fear you may have months of bliss and a honeymoon stage again but beware, because the same patterns, same issues, same dynamic will always reappear if the proper work has not been done.

Share it with friends, family your therapist Talk it through over and over again. Say it to yourself. Recognize how you feel today. Maybe it is the same as yesterday..maybe it is a little different. But keep talking about it and sharing how you feel. Processing it is necessary. Sometimes we have to say the same things 13 times to really feel heard 3. Stay busy not avoidant. Do not just do things to fill your time. Do the things you love to do because YOU LOVE TO DO THEM. Keeping parts of your identity during this time is crucial. A big part of your identity just got wiped being a partner . so it is critical that your other roles are intact. You may not be a partner anymore, but you are still the rest of yourself. Do not let those parts go 4. Exercise. Every. Day. when you work out you are not just doing a great thing for your body, you are also cleaning your mind. When a relationship ends, we are generally pretty emotionally flooded that means the emotions can take over, often times leaving us feeling like we are drowning. When we work out, we release endorphins, serotonin, dopamine .it boosts our mood and decreases our pain. It helps us think about what is happened from a clearer space. We need that 5. Surround yourself with people who love you. you may not be feeling particularly lovable. That narrative gets questioned so being around people who remind you that you are loved and cared about is necessary As you begin to do these things, you begin to learn how to exist without that person.

Turn inwardly and remind yourself that you are enough. Look for things that are self satisfying and uplifting cook, workout, read, write, watch movies or your favorite shows, go for a walk, find something beautiful outside, sit and observe others, or yourself . The possibilities are endless you just need to find what is soothing for you. So, the next time you feel lonely, find a way to take care of yourself without the escape from yourself. You are enough, and once you begin to adopt that thought, you will be able to attract that from someone else. You will be able to choose someone instead of need them. That is a beautiful, beautiful thing.'},\n",

It is got your back and it is coming for you if it has not already. Let it. And let it be the most beautiful accident you have ever had.'},\n",

We can spin and spin and spin our wheels trying to figure out what it is we could be doing differently what it is we need to change about ourselves to be enough for this person to finally make us feel that way but if they are not ready, the outcome does not change. Maybe we should ask ourselves why we entertain people who are not ready? What keeps us from walking away? Is our sense of worth strong enough to walk away from a relationship that does not fill us up? Are we even ready? Do our narratives support us in a way that sets us up for relational success, or do we believe that we are undeserving of full, complete, ready love? No one will ever be enough for a person who is not ready. Let that sink in. Stop looking for love from people who can not give it to you. Love yourself enough to show up for yourself and choose people who are ready and willing to do the work with you. We often attract what we are ready for or what we think we are deserving of. Take some time to identify that. Get real with yourself. Ask how ready am I? And, do I believe that I am deserving of love and a partner who shows up?

We try to control and mastermind a way to make it all go according to our plan. There is a difference between setting goals and being attached to an outcome. We should set goals. We should challenge ourselves and grow to be great in whatever it is we seek. But needing to control an outcome really does not work out in our favor. Too much of our self worth gets wrapped up in it. We need something to happen, otherwise we are not good enough, smart enough, loved enough . The things we can not control we need to work towards letting go .letting go of it going the way we want it to go. Just because we can not control love does not mean we give up on it. We work towards being a better partner, setting clear boundaries, we work towards self love and living our most authentic lives that is the way we show up. But if we just work towards controlling love it will not ever show up in its best form. TRY THIS Think about all of the things you can not control in your life right now. Make a list. What is on that list? Now think about what you have been doing to try to control it? What have you been forcing? Has it been working? In what ways? How not? Now think about letting go of that control. How does that feel? What does it look like in your life? What do you envision? Picture the most beautiful setting of you letting go and creating a space of total freedom instead of control. What is around you? Are you smiling? Can you breathe easily? Capture that. Let those things come towards you. Create a space for it to freely show up instead of controlling it to be there. Work on yourself, set goals, and create a space for freedom where you once controlled. See how life changes.'},\n",

I have found it incredibly helpful to switch my thinking around this. How deeply did I transform? How much growth do did I have with this person, has he challenged me and shed light on my blind spots? Has this relationship challenged and encouraged me to be better? The answers to these questions tell us how deeply we have been moved how deeply we have been transformed. So much of our own personal and relational success comes from our ability to see and embrace opportunity for transformation. So take a look. Have your relationships transformed you?

What we focus our attention on will occupy our minds and from there we can feel a ton of emotion that will tell us either negative or positive based thoughts about who we are, what we are doing, and where we are going. Makes sense, right? If we are gazing and focused on the negative, we are more likely to feel negative emotions, and if we see and focus on the positives, we are going to feel better about things. This we know, yet we often times find ourselves sliding into a space where we are occupied with more negatives than positives. This needs to change. Research shows that with couples we need a minimum of 5:1 positive to negative exchanges as a baseline for happy healthy relationships. Why would it be any different than our relationship with ourselves? If we are constantly thinking or focused on negative thoughts and we are not having at least 5 positive thoughts to negate the negative one, we are going to fall into a space where the lens through which we see life is negative. Focus on the positive. No need to avoid the negative feel it, give it a space to breathe, but then find the beauty around it. Find what is going right, and look to see how the negative is for you.

Are you holding because of fear or are you choosing to gift space for someone who needs it? Holding is sometimes necessary.

We screw up sometimes badly. But forgiving ourselves is a must. More often than not, we are just as frustrated and hurt with ourselves than anyone else. Yet we avoid processing the anger and hurt that we carry around. Maybe we are angry with ourselves for letting our sister get hit we question why it was not us and then wish we could go back and protect her from it. Or, we have such disgust for ourselves after spending all of our savings and are ashamed and embarrassed that we can not buy our children the things they want. Before we do anything, we must give ourselves permission to forgive ourselves. It does not mean that what we have done is okay it just means that we accept that we are human and did not know how to handle that time any differently. We must be gentler with ourselves. Forgive for not knowing better, and then grow. Grow from that space. Commit to being better. Commit to handling things differently. Remind yourself that you are not re-entering that old space, but rather stepping into something new. You deserve forgiveness. You are human and you are imperfect.'},\n",

So if your purpose is not clear, search for it discover it now. It is never too late. Do not allow anything to get in your way. If nothing mattered except your joy, what would you be doing? Do that and then share it with the world.'},\n",

Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not given by the other. It is so easy to fall into a space where we possess the other. We may preach freedom, but most of the time we want people to do what we want them to do and then how we feel becomes dependent on whether we successfully control that or not. The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. We have come to believe the opposite. We have come to adopt messages like you complete me you are my other half and we are taught that being alone is lonely. We are sent messages that there is something wrong if someone is single . Why are you single? You seem like a great catch! We have it wrong. Being alone is not something to be ashamed of. Being alone successfully is something to be celebrated. It is deliberate time spent making that space great. Whether you are in a relationship or not, being alone is a critical component of our overall health. We need to spend time with ourselves and only ourselves often. We have to make our solitude beautiful because when we do, we can begin to love others without any need from them. It is beautiful freedom. It is love at its purest. So take time to be alone. Learn yourself and challenge your thoughts.

It is especially difficult to accept when things seem to be going pretty well. Maybe there are not any clear red flags maybe most days are really positive, and overall we are pretty happy. I think we are becoming more receptive to seeing our losses as gains We talk often about it creating space for something better, but let is expand on it a bit more. We lose great things because we have grown or the other person has . We lose great things because we have worked at it and have earned something more or they have . Losing great things is not a punishment it is either earned or a calling. We do not get greater things without working for them, but most of the time they come disguised. Most of the time they present as something painful. When things change in our lives, it is because we have either done the work to receive something greater or the other person has. It is more difficult when it is the other person because we are generally blinded by the change but that space can call us to our growth if we allow it and you guessed it, something greater comes too. We struggle the most when we choose to stay stuck. When our narratives allow us to ask why is this happening to me? Great things come when we do the work. Great things come when we choose to grow. Great things are all around us right now, but they will not be enough down the road. As we grow, the things and people around us need to as well. If you commit your life to growth, you will always be choosing a greater you, and you will demand more from yourself and others. Growth will be had and it will come to you as earned or as a calling. Accept both. Remember that it is always for you, and that greatness is around the corner if you are willing to accept what it asks of you.'},\n",

Challenging ourselves to step away from criticism and judgment. To step away from thinking we know and step towards learning. Sure, we may not have the opportunity to learn about the stranger walking by us, or the man screaming into his phone, but I would like to challenge us to believe and assume good intent. Yes, we may be wrong some of the time, but the majority of us are doing the best we can. Everyone has a story and no single moment should ever be confused for the whole. It is not always easy to walk away from judgment we want people to be better we want them to know the things we know but we also do not know what they know.

It is worth the read. Here are his words: 3. Happiness is different than Joy I just want to be happy. I hear that all the time. But what IS happiness? Happiness is an emotional response to an outcome If I win I will be happy, if I do not I will not . An if-then , cause and effect, quid pro quo standard that we cannot sustain because we immediately raise it every time we attain it. You see, happiness demands a certain outcome, it is result reliant. If happiness is what you are after, then you are going to be let down frequently and be unhappy much of your time. Joy, though, is something else. It is not a choice, not a response to some result, it is a constant. Joy is the feeling we have from doing what we are fashioned to do, no matter the outcome. Personally, as an actor, I started enjoying my work and literally being happier when I stopped trying to make the daily labor a means to a certain end I need this film to be a box office success, I need my performance to be acknowledged, I need the respect of my peers. All reasonable aspirations but truth is, as soon as the WORK, the MAKING of the movie, the DOING of the deed became the reward in itself I got more box-office , more accolades and respect than I would ever had before.

Maybe we are supposed to be quiet maybe we were part of a family system that did not value our thoughts maybe no one ever asked maybe keeping the peace within an already chaotic family system meant staying quiet maybe men are not supposed to have emotions or as a woman you have been criticized for your emotions being too emotional needy crazy. The list can go on and on. It is important to understand what it is that actually keeps us from sharing what is really going on? Think about that. When you feel something, what do you say to yourself that stops you from sharing it. Identify that first. Now let is try to understand why? What is happened that is supported that fear? Maybe it is past experiences with that person? Maybe it is messages you received growing up from family society? You see, the problem with saying I am fine when we are actually feeling something else is that we send ourselves the message that we are not important enough to challenge the narrative that is keeping us quiet. It is like we have accepted the narratives as truth or we have accepted our role as one that we are stuck in for life. We stop fighting for it to be different. We begin to believe there is no use anyway. We are all important enough to challenge those narratives. We have the capacity to choose differently. We are capable of changing our role within relationships and voicing our feelings and having them be heard. But we must always believe that we are important enough and not a problem to be heard.

Sometimes we hold while a person figures certain things out on their own but we can not be the only one working at it forever. The most remarkable relational growth will always come when two people are working at it together. Invite your partner to show up invite yourself to show up. If either of you struggles with fighting for the relationship, ask yourself what is keeping you from doing it? What are you avoiding? What are your fears? Fight for your relationship every day. Ask your partner how you did today? Ask how you were as a partner? Learn and be open. Commit to growth every day. Commit to loving harder to showing up better. Commit to speaking their language, and commit to having yours understood. Speak and listen and fight. But just remember, you are more powerful as two.

When we question that, we generally act out in some way we still have a little kid in us . It is the unresolved part of us that acts out instead of putting words to our unmet emotional needs. So, we push the boundaries. We do not pick up a call or we go out with our friends and do not stay in touch. We send a message without words. If I am not your priority, you are not going to be mine. We become emotionally irresponsible without giving clarity to our partner. When we hurt we act out and attempt to hurt the other. We begin to doubt our importance and value in their lives. We begin to question our worth. This can spiral and get out of control. When we question our worth, we aim to protect ourselves in whatever way we can. Often it is in this boundary pushing. You probably know exactly how you do it. We need to start putting the right words to what we are feeling instead of making our partner pay for it. We need to create space for our partner is purpose, while still requesting to be their most prioritized human. It is not about testing their fight for us. It is about creating space for them to thrive in all the other areas of their life while calling them to show up for us .to prioritize us as their most important person. So talk. Share when you do not feel like a priority. And also remember to pay attention to all the ways our partners do make us a priority. Create a space for their purpose to thrive, and do not aim to strip them of that. Other things can be more important, we just want to be the most important human. Do not get purpose and passion confused with our role in their lives. Ask yourself have I prioritized my partner today?

I like when people use their words to communicate what they are feeling. I think it is a pretty effective way of being heard and understanding things.

So often in that space, a person is whispering to themselves of course I want you to stay, but I can not control you you have to decide on your own. OR, I am so sorry, I would do anything to repair this, but I am so ashamed and embarrassed of my actions I am not even convinced you should forgive me. Certainly, that is not always the case sometimes an ending is just that. Sometimes that person just does not want back in, or does not care. Sometimes after an affair, there really is not remorse and the person is ready to end things altogether. The point is, silence can mean so much more than we ever give it credit for. Be curious about silence instead of just making assumptions. Begging and pleading is not always the right way to communicate something.

My reaction to him when I walk through the door is always the same. Every single day for the last 6 years I know I am going to be met with love, and that I am going to give it away.

Only to discover that in the end, love was never meant to be received by one person but rather all the people who make us feel at home. We do not have to become bitter about love. We have to open ourselves up to it. We fear never living to meet love instead of opening our eyes to see the love that is already all around us. We put pressure on a love that sweeps us off our feet, instead of reminding ourselves to be grounded and rooted in the moments that have given us that gift already. You see, sometimes love is just an insane collection of moments. Not a destination, but a story. A story about a compilation of love that is been thrown our way. You have already met love. It may not be in the form of a life long partner or marriage just yet and it may not be a fairy tale, or a fantasy meticulously planned but it is in other forms. Do not let bitterness and fear lead you astray from love. Find gratitude. Highlight your collection of moments, and open yourself up to receiving love in its different shapes and sizes.

Does the person communicate clearly, do they shut down and just disappear, do they place all the blame on you, are they stepping into something new that elevates them, or going back to something that keeps them playing small? Are they inconsiderate, disrespectful, mean, shut down, or defensive, or are they kind, calm, honest, and willing to take ownership for where they are right now? We can not keep a person from leaving that is not our job, but we can learn a lot about a person by the way in which they do it and similarly we can learn a lot about ourselves. Most people prefer clear closure. People have a yearning to understand. We want to make sense of things. We believe that if we can understand, then we can be released. Unfortunately, some people leave and they do not or can not give us the clarity we seek. They do not provide answers. They do not help us understand. What I say to that?

If you take anything away from this post, take this: we are all a part of many different systems and the way each part of the system functions impacts the other parts and the whole. We are a part of a family system, friendship system, work system, community, team etc. We have a role in all of these systems. And we feel a certain way about ourselves in those systems. We have a job to do, and if we do not do it well, the whole system will be impacted. Similarly, if the rest of the system is not doing their part, it will be difficult for you to thrive in your role. But most systems do not like to take any ownership for their part when another part is not succeeding. Sure, we can all independently thrive, but we will always be at our best if all parts of the system are functioning at their greatest. So when that flower is not blooming, we do not just send the flower off to therapy we do not just tell that flower that it needs to get its act together or else. We look at the other parts of the system. We change the amount of sunlight or water we check the soil. Ideally, the flower, water, sun, and soil would all come into therapy and we would talk about each part but seriously. We have to stop placing blame on just one part of any system. Check the environment. If someone is struggling ask yourself what you could be doing differently? If one part of your system is not great, you have a part in that.

It is important to understand our inner narrative we need to understand what it is we tell ourselves each and every day about being loved. Do we believe it? Are we worthy of love? Or have we come to accept that we are unlovable? We need to dissect that further and understand from where those narratives come? What were we told about love growing up? How did we receive it? Was it conditional? Were we made to fear the withdrawal of love? When we understand what drives our narratives, we can gain more control over our thoughts. We can begin to challenge parts of our narrative that keep us from receiving love, and we can expand on the parts that do not . The second part is understanding our love languages. Often we give and receive love differently than those around us. Research has boiled the languages down to FIVE: acts of service, quality time, words of affirmation, physical touch, and gifts. These are the ways we all give and receive love but just think If your love languages are quality time and physical touch, but your partner gives thoughtful gifts and words of affirmation to demonstrate his love for you, it is easy to question whether or not the love is even there.

They question if they have ever been loved, and if their family even cares about them. One of the things that we work on is expanding our definition of family. Maybe it does not have to only be blood. Maybe family is anyone who shows up? Maybe we get to create who we keep in the intimate space with us. I have noticed that people do much better once they release themselves from a narrative about family that only defines it as blood related. We have been given the message that blood is thicker than water except maybe it is not. Maybe blood is only thicker than water when it is showing up. When it is well and alive. Family is supposed to be there they are supposed to care the most. It is unconditional love. Except a lot of times it is not. And that is tough.

Second chances can be the most beautiful decision we have ever made. And saying hell no might be a response we never ever change or reconsider. I would like to offer two things to consider in helping decide what decision makes the most sense for you. When someone tries to re-enter your life, make sure you understand the growth they have achieved while they were away. If you are going to let someone back in, they should be able to clearly explain how they have grown, and what areas they know will be different they need awareness otherwise, it is likely that you will create the same patterns that led to that ending in the first place. Secondly, ask yourself what is driving your decision? For example, do you want to say yes because you have clearly understood their growth, or is it because you are tired of being alone? Make sure your motivating force is clean. And consider what it will be like if it ends for the second time. Can you be at peace with that? Is it okay for this person to re-enter and only take you a little bit further in your journey? Sometimes our answers are through trial and error, but if people want to re-enter without doing any work, it is likely a decision that will create the same outcome as before.

From the start, Jakes says, some parents are not capable of giving an outpouring of love to their children, because they have a pint-sized capacity and cannot fill those who have a 10-gallon capacity to love. This is important because it is the first example of love we receive. If our parents or caretakers are not ten gallon people but we are, we may start to question whether love is meant to feel the way we feel it? Maybe we question if we are enough since we never feel full of love? The doubt can take over. Maybe we think we are supposed to partner with someone who has a pint capacity.

When someone walks away we must find a way to say thank you. I know that can sometimes feel impossible, but both people are in need of the ending.

Tampering with love never works. When we try to control outcomes we taint and dilute love. It is no longer pure.

The perfect child, the perfect friend, the perfect employee, the perfect parent, the perfect partner. When in all actuality, we are beautifully wired for imperfection. It is rooted in our internal mapping, it lives deep within our own personal coding. Our flaws make us who we are, they fuel our own unique purpose and what we have to offer the world that NO ONE else can. So why is it so hard to show that side of us? I spent a lot of time energy trying to hide the real me, mainly out of fear and the belief I created in my head that no one would love my messy parts. So I went throughout life living in the story that what I had to offer was not good enough and I molded myself around the idea of what I thought I should be. It took a handful of heartbreak and a few bruised egos for me to figure out that what I was attracting in my life that was feeding into my unhappiness was out of the fact the universe was giving me people and circumstances that were aligned with the fake image I was showing up as. It is called sympathetic vibrations for we magnetize and receive what we put out there. When I chose to stop trying to become something I was not , and chose to un-become and unfold to who I have always been by shifting my perception and shedding the stories, I was able to be the girl that struggles, the girl that fails, the girl feels everything, but also the girl is unabashedly herself, the girl that is beautifully vulnerable and loves all-out without fear or regret.

It is inherently human to want to understand why we do what we do so we can make sense of it. When we understand it, it can breed more awareness, and awareness is a giant step towards change. But it is easy to get stuck in the need to understand And it is also easy to get fixated on the work and addicted to personal growth.. because if we are growing then no one will ask us questions no one will force us to actually do anything. We get to play the language game and dance in the semantics of working on ourselves . So sometimes it is much simpler to just let go of the need to make it all make sense. Some stuff and people will just never be understood. And thankfully, understanding our past is not the only way to move beyond it. It takes the desire to change for change to take place.

We can choose, that from this moment forward we will not tolerate mediocrity from ourselves or others. Our lives are composed of so many moments and experiences, and the beautiful thing is that we get to decide what they all mean for us.

There is an essential component to all great relationships that from an intellectual level is super simple but can be much more challenging to implement; the best partners have great boundaries . And it does not just stop at great relationship partners, it is what having amazing boundaries communicates to those around us that we believe we deserve the highest level of respect. The advice we usually receive is this area is the typically flippant suggestion to just stand up for yourself or just tell her him what you want need . If it was that simple, we would all do it. All of us would be getting what we want and life would be all puppy dogs and ice cream. But it is not. Because the reality is that having strong boundaries can often be misconstrued as saying no to love. Or that we are not accepting someone as they are with their struggles. Having strong boundaries is saying no to mediocrity for us, from us, and from others. And I want you to see that having effective boundaries has a beautiful side-effect ; it communicates to us that what we want is important, and that we have a high level of self worth. To the person receiving the boundary the message is similar this person loves and respects themselves so much that they will not accept this behavior from me. Self-worth is like food, we need it constantly or we will begin to starve and the food we need is having a life that reflects the decisions and choices that someone with a high level of self-respect would have. It takes a commitment to who we want to be and the life we want for it to become so and know that these things can all be cultivated over time. We do not need to be perfect, we just need to strive for progress.

Happy or sad with the loss, it is still a loss. And our lives and our identity as someone in a relationship needs to shift. For many, this acceptance and time to discover ourselves and what we have learned is too much to bear. BUT We must. Because in that space is where we do the building and become a stronger and better partner for the next person. I know that the pain of loss can be so great that sometimes we just want company . But if we go into something too early and when we are not happy yet alone, we put that on our partners. They become our bandaid to dealing with what is really going on in our hearts. We are not choosing them out of love We are choosing them out of the fear of facing our pain and listening to the cries of our soul. Being single is a beautiful time to construct the type of person we have always wanted to be and to create a life that the right partner will fit perfectly into. Take that space and time to listen to things you have always run from So you can finally stop running and just be. Choose love from a peaceful heart Then it is sure to last.'},\n",

To let go is to cherish memories, and overcome and move on. Letting go is about accepting. It is learning and experiencing and evolving.

Not all toxic people in our lives have cruel hearts or are inherently bad people, a lot of the time they have pure and loving intentions for us. But just because people hold great love for us, does not necessarily mean they are right for us. A lot of the time toxicity in a relationship forces us to compromise our well-being simply because the other person is needs and emotions overshadow ours. Maybe they are not choosing to grow side-by side with us and would rather shrink back into what is comfortable, maybe they are not at the level of self-loving awareness we are, or maybe they are unable to maintain their happiness and rely on us to do all of the work for them. Whatever it may look like for you, if it is holding you back or causing you to sacrifice your happiness to keep them secure in your relationship, it is usually best for both parties if you let them go. Being a human being is work on its own, let alone trying to be everything for someone else too. When we step up and fill the gaps in others for them, instead of with them, we not only enable them to flatline, it also becomes exhausting and unsustainable for ourselves. Whether it be letting go of relationship with a love, a friend or a family member, sometimes you must love people from a distance. You should never have to apologize for removing yourself from a situation that is painful or hurtful for you or to you. Reclaim your space and make yourself your priority, it is always okay to create a safer space for you and your happiness.'},\n",

I did not know how to communicate effectively or have them always feel understood simply put, I was not ready. And I only know that now because they were my teachers.

Not just in the anniversary and Valentine is Day kind of way, more so in a weekly fashion. If you have kids, remember you are always a couple before you are parents, you must make the time to cultivate your relationship. We often hear that wouldate nights' are really important, and although that is true, I want us to recognize that it actually requires a little more than just having time together. It requires the time together to have novelty, adventure, and co-creation , Sure, a night on the couch watching movies and making dinner is great But we have done it 1000 times. We know what to expect A massage and some booty hopefully . So there is no surprise. Humans require novelty Old relationships become old because we do not keep things new. This is so important to understand. And relationships that have date nights will do ok.. They will be averagely good. But couples that try new things together and cultivate new memories are more likely to thrive. Because doing new things which are exciting and adventurous, tricks our brains and hearts into associating our partner with those things Making them feel new and reigniting connection. That is one of the best ways to keep love alive. Let is quit being lazy and doing the same old sh t.

Have you ever noticed that when a friendship splits, a love ends or a connection of any kind breaks, the moving on process becomes easier for us if we are angry? It is as if we can find anything to get mad about. Suddenly any word they say, their mere presence in a room, their name being brought into conversation, or even a selfie being posted on social media can take us from zero to pissed in a matter of moments. Anger is easy. Hating is easy. It means we do not have to fully own how it is we really actually feel deep down inside. Hurt. Abandoned. Ego bruised. Or maybe we are just mad at ourselves for still holding love for them. This way of being allows us to stay in a mentality where it is all them and not us. How could we still have love for someone that broke our hearts? But that is the thing though. By us choosing to not love, we are actually doing an even greater disservice to ourselves. Hate is too heavy a burden to carry around. It is not fertile ground for acceptance or change, it is not a space that fosters growth or evolution. By us choosing to love people, choosing to love them through the process, through our letting go, is one of the strongest things we can ever do. Love is light, it flows freely. It creates opportunity for you to move forward without any attachment or baggage. It allows you to celebrate who people were for you, and who they still are for you, because at one moment in time you both were exactly what you needed. They helped shape us into who we are today and what is there to hate about that? No matter what people say or do or how badly they may hurt us, it is never too late to forgive and show love for people, even if that means loving from a distance and even if that means no longer having them as part of your life.

We do not give ourselves an opportunity to heal. Healing is not the absence of hurt it is in the muddy waters it is in the re-wounding , the messiness, the speaking up for oneself the small change that turns into a massive one. Healing can not happen without hurt. And if we just run from it constantly, we are not actually allowing ourselves to take away what it is we need to apply next time. Sure, it is lousy. We do not wish for it, but when we lean into it to gain its teachings, we come out the other side wiser. I always say, it is not about living a life void of hurt and pain it is about making our hurt and pain wiser. Commit to the lean. Do not let the fear make you run.

It is everything you wish you learned wrapped up in a one day event! You will not want to miss it and the early bird tickets will sell out fast. So here is your heads up to look for it tomorrow morning! CAPTION We are constantly impacting people and people are constantly impacting us. We are touching lives, and we are meaning a tremendous amount to others. We are hours for some, days, weekends, months, years, or lifetimes .and it all matters. The good the bad the lessons. Most of our relationships are the helpers. They budge us a little closer, and we budge them. We reveal hard truths, and they challenge fears. We leap and they do not and sometimes they leap and it is just not for us. The process of moving closer can be a tough one. It is painful at times the perception of rejection, or the narratives that sink in a bit further that hear us repeating will I ever find love? We touch people is lives all the time. Never forget that. And keep holding hope, because somewhere along the way it will be at the same time. You will leap, and they will leap.

When I was getting my masters at Northwestern, I was fortunate to be a part of leading an undergraduate course called Marriage 101 . It was the course that we have all wanted at least knew we wanted since middle school. I mean, I love Algebra and do use it but let is be real, learning how to be in a healthy, successful relationship romantic, friendship, familial, professional is what it is all about. We NEED this, but not many of us get it. So Marriage 101 started teaching college kids everything it is we all wished we knew about relationships. We started talking about boundaries, partner selection, what goes into the greatest relationship, and how to create that for ourselves. It goes without surprise that still to this day it is the most popular and sought after elective at Northwestern. I would love this to be taught in elementary school, but it is not yet so instead, we will take the approach of it is never too late and I will invite you to join me in VANCOUVER for a Relationship 101 event.

Healing is trying to nudge itself into our consciousness. The lessons may be delivered with painful packaging but it is through the process of unwrapping it all that we come to discover the gifts. It is not our timeline. We just have to keep moving ourselves through the pain. We have to keep our head lifted to look for the good that is amidst the pain. It is there and when we are having trouble finding it we surrender to trusting that it is either coming, or we are not quite yet ready to receive it.

They need to feel like we have space in our lives for them otherwise, what is the point? Seriously .why stick around? What does it even matter if you have it all covered on your own anyway? We have to create space in our lives for others. We have to make room for them to have purpose in our lives.

Too many of us run into the arms of perceived togetherness because we do not like ourselves when we are alone. The narratives we tell ourselves are cruel and untrue, but we have subscribed to them and commit to avoiding ourselves. It is important that we are able to enjoy our alone that we successfully learn how to exist in that space, and use it as a marker to know when a person adds true value to our lives or when they are just being used as a filler. You see, that is the problem when we do not love our solitude. We confuse love. We confuse feeling better with simply avoiding. We often hear that we must love ourselves before someone else can or that we have to be happy alone before we can be happy with another person. I am not sure that is always true, that there are not exceptions to that but what I do think is important is that if we need a person to help us avoid ourselves than we can not ever have our greatest love with them. We essentially wind up using them to escape ourselves, instead of using people to embrace it all. Improve your solitude so you can love and be loved fully. Love your alone, so that you are clear when a person actually enhances your life instead of helps you avoid it. We all have the capacity to love ourselves.

It hurts so much when we leap and people are not there to catch us. So of course it makes sense that time after time pushes us into a space where we have walls up. It is easy to shut down it is easy to stay guarded it is easy to turn away from vulnerability when we do not trust that the people on the other side will hear us. But what we have to keep doing is keep sharing ourselves over and over again. Just because most people up until now have not gotten it, does not mean that our future does not hold security in that space. The only way we have a chance at it is by sharing our heart.

It is easy to question if this relationship can only take you so far? It is easy to fantasize about a connection that is just deeper or simply easier. It is easy to think that somewhere along the way we just took a turn away from each other. It is easy to throw in the towel. Sometimes it winds up being necessary and the right decision, but other times it is testing and growing you. It is demanding more. Underneath all of the doubt, confusion, anger, criticism, and frustration is misunderstanding, hurt, pain, and emotional needs that are not getting met. It is tough when we are at the end of our rope to have the motivation to do the work with one another, but it is possible. I want you to know it is possible. That does not guarantee an outcome, but I am amazed by the capacity of human beings. I am amazed day in and day out by people who just prove time and time again that there is hope even when two people can not see it. Most of the time when we get to this point, you will need professional help, but this is also a good reminder to check in with your partner often. Ask, how was I as a partner this week? What could I have done better? Do you feel heard and understood do you feel secure? Stay on it before your lack of energy keeps you from trying as hard.

Sometimes we need to calm ourselves down and clear our minds, and I often suggest time outs for couples, but it is important not to abandon. It is important to create safety and security even when time is needed to cool off. It is easy to stay when things are going well, but we need to learn how to stay even when things are tough. It is in the mess that we tend not to feel safe. So this is about creating that security, working on communication, helping your partner understand and learn that even though it is tough right now, the two of you will be able to get through it together. Our partners need to know, to truly know, that we are not leaving even when the going gets tough. We all need security. We all need to trust in our ability to work through it. Eliminate criticism, defensiveness, contempt and stonewalling total shutting down . John Gottman is data shows that these are relationship killers , and when present, keep couples from creating security in their relationships. These things are leaving . They are a version of it. When we do any of them, we wind up abandoning what is most important. We wind up stepping away from our hurt and hearing one another, and we either go on the attack or just shut down. We have to work ourselves away from that, otherwise we are always just chipping away at the relationship. Just because we come back afterwards, does not mean the damage is not done. It is.

Sometimes it is not wrapped in a pretty bow with two people who amicably say this is for the better. Sure, maybe we know that is true on some level, but most of the time our closure seems to be messier than we wish it. I have found that one of the hardest parts of moving on is processing the loss of the fantasy of the future. It is not so much about it ending in that moment let is face it most of the time the relationship is not healthy anymore and it ending actually makes sense it is more about losing the thoughts about what life was going to be like with this person. What the future held with them the first house bought, the kids, the family traditions all of it. The loss of that can penetrate so deeply even if we have been unhappy for a long time. That is why this quote from is so helpful. You see, we get closer to closure when we accept that letting go of the fantasy of the future is something that is keeping us stuck. We get closer to closure when it is more important to embrace the now instead of living for the what ifs. Your loss is a real loss. It is devastating and sometimes paralyzingly, but it is also not your greatest future. It is not your greatest love. And that is reason enough to release from the hold it has on you.

Go check out the caption she wrote to her quote. It is SO normal to keep knocking at a closed door. It may seem like the answer is obvious, but when we are in it just in the trenches of it all, we are looking to get some type of message that contradicts the negative narrative that we have playing over and over again in our head. That door closing looks a whole lot like rejection. It really feels that way too, even when a part of us may know that it is just a redirection. Nonetheless, we want the person who has hurt us to be the person who changes how we feel. We want them to say something or do something that stops us from feeling what we are feeling that stops those negative narratives from running their course and we truly believe it is only they who can save us from it. That is just not true. We save ourselves by knocking and receiving the message but turning the distorted negative narrative into ones that reveals what it is we actually need. The hurt is real, but it is what we do with it that matters. Knocking over and over again is not so bad there is plenty to learn through that process, but it is about rewriting what we tell ourselves in that space. While we knock are we bashing ourselves, or are we trying to gain insight? While we knock are we trying to control an outcome, or are we clarifying answers and processing our confusion? That space is critical. And in it, we must allow ourselves to believe in a better future a future that holds stronger and healthy narratives. Ones that lift us up and trust in secure relationships. We keep knocking because we want a different answer but we are doing it expecting it from the wrong people. Knock and gain what it is you need, and then move on to the next door. It will be answered with newly written narratives that will lead you further.'},\n",

We fear that people will not be able to show up for us, or that they will just choose not to. We start to think I have been let down before, so why would this time be any different? So we step away from our needs we internalize them and cross or fingers in hopes that our people will just know. That someone will care about us enough to maybe just ask. There is always a narrative that is keeping us from speaking up. There is something there that is convincing us out of speaking our needs and openly sharing them with our partner. That is something for you to challenge and explore for yourself and identify. But here is something that is really important. The strongest couples are ones that can share it all with each other. They tell each other what it is they need. They tell each other how to love them. They build trust around when I have a need, you will hear it. They do not always meet every need that is not what it is about but they create an environment that feels safe to share and express it all. It is a space that feels safe to be vulnerable. These couples use their words the right way. They express their need in a way that is easy for their partner to understand. And their partner responds to it. That person lets them know it is been heard. We will always be let down when we do not ask for what we need. Our partners are not mind readers, and part of our growth is honoring ourselves in order to be heard. It is a lesson we can always use practice in. So work towards vulnerability. Work towards clearly communicating what your needs and expectations are, and give your partner a chance to show up and hear it. Every time you avoid yourself, you wind up abandoning your needs. Set people up for success set yourself up for success. Your words are the gateway to your needs being met.'},\n",

With them there is always an opportunity for growth, personal understanding, and development.

When we are in pain, it is far simpler for us to be reactive. It is easier for us to react from an emotionally flooded space. When we get there, it is difficult for us to always choose words and actions that help us feel safe and protected again. We tend to add to the hurt by one upping being critical defensive or just shutting down. This does not help. And just because we are hurting does not mean we have free rein to put it right back out there. We are responsible for the way we respond. Of course we are human and we can not do it perfectly all of the time, but we need to become more accountable. It is not good enough to say I would not have done this if you had not done that . It does not work. We have to remember that everything we say and do sends a message to those around us. We need to ask ourselves if that message aligns with us if it aligns with what it is we really need, and if this is the best way that we can put the message out to the world or our partner?

So many of us mean well but we let our fears run the show. We let our fears take over and keep us from honoring our word. And in that process we hurt other people. We create a sense of distrust, and we make it so they can not feel emotionally secure. When there is not emotional security, love can not thrive. Love can not be its best.

That is why love can be so scary; there is no certainty. Hollllldddd on . but we took vows! yes, you did. You promised to stay together NO MATTER WHAT. Whether you subscribe to that or not, what is not spoken in that space is a vow to remain happy forever a vow that we will not emotionally leave one another. Yes, you may not divorce or exit the relationship by actually physically leaving, but you may leave emotionally. Promising happiness forever or to emotionally be engaged at all times is not possible. We can not promise that because we are human. Period. So instead of looking to control outcomes and demand promises from others demand it from yourself. You are only in control of yourself and sometimes that is even a stretch . Promise what you know you can give and then talk about the rest. Focus on being the best partner. Focus on nurturing your happiness. Focus on strengthening the Self, and maintaining your roles and identity. Love yourself. Honor yourself. Honor your partner. Show up in the best way you can and then do better tomorrow. You will encourage the same in your partner you will attract that back and if you do not , you are still prepared to choose yourself even if someone else can not .\"},\n",

We have learned to encourage it and often we can even convince ourselves to look forward to it by turning lessons into growth. But sometimes we forget how much pain and hurt can accompany it. Maybe we need to slow down and not just jump to the outcome. Yes, growth is great, but we need to acknowledge that the weeks, months, and years leading up to it can be treacherous sometimes the most painful and difficult times of our lives. Yes, we will get there but processing through the loss mourning and grieving whatever it may be is a process that needs to be honored and understood. Too often we are quick to minimize it. Too often we forget about the bigger picture and just focus on the content. He was not good for you anyway. You will meet someone much better next. This may be spoken with the hope of encouraging a friend or family member, but the loss is far greater than the person. It is layers of loss that we do not always understand. It is loss of the future. It is loss of self esteem. It is loss of a role and major part of an identity. Wherever we have an opportunity for growth, we are always having to mourn a part of ourselves that we are giving up. That can be anything. But with growth comes leaving something behind and even if it is ultimately for something great, there is still a process that needs deliberate, compassionate attention. Be kind to yourself. No need to rush. Your mourning is teaching you something. Your growth will come from it, but honor it and understand the different layers of loss first.'},\n",

I want to give my children what my parents gave me. I want to provide so much more than what I got. Can I even do this? Will my relationship fail? Is it okay if I want to work and be a mom? Flooding thoughts and fears can accompany the joy and excitement and sometimes we just do not know how to process it all. If you were fortunate, you received some beautiful messages and lessons from your mom your dad or maybe just strong female and male figures in your life.

There are plenty of things that can contribute to that :: new job, loss of job, loss of a loved one, baby on the way etc. But as we flow through what is thrown at us, we can not abandon ourselves. Things are allowed to be hard, but that does not give allowance towards being mistreated.

This is for the people who tend to be the ones getting broken up with this is for the people who get left more than they do the leaving. Hell, maybe you have never broken up with anyone in your life. So let is look at it. What was your role in the family? Did you have to keep things together for everyone? Did you avoid voicing any issues or problems to the family in fear that they could not handle any more? Maybe they were dealing with SO much already, so you felt there was not any room for you to bring any of your stuff to them? Maybe your parents got divorced and you were asked to choose between the two and you wanted to make sure that no one is feelings got hurt so you quieted your wants and just tried to make everyone happy. Or maybe you tried voicing something and you got punished for it. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. I do not know your story, but I do know there are fears that keep us from honoring ourselves and I know that there are narratives that support those fears. Narratives that keep you from honoring your voice speaking your truth, and trusting that it is okay to. Maybe you are afraid of hurting others letting them down. Maybe you do not know that it is safe to step into that space for fear of something bad happening. Whatever it is it needs your attention. It needs to be understood because sometimes we do have to go. Sometimes we do have to end things. But we always have to honor ourselves.

Being a great partner demands that we allow our partners to be there for us to show up. It demands that we ask for our needs to get met, and that we communicate them clearly. Great partnership goes both ways. Do not get stuck thinking you are a great partner because of how much you give. Remember that you have to find ways to receive as well otherwise our partners do not have a chance of giving us their beautiful love. It is not for you to take that away from them. Do not deny them their role and purpose in your life. And if this feels difficult for you to do, consider the narratives that are keeping you stuck. What are the messages you received around receiving love, or being able to ask for things? Were you always the giver in your family? Was that your role? Were you allowed to have needs? Try to understand what keeps you stuck so that you can loosen yourself from those messages. You are not just a giver. That is not the only role for you.

Unfortunately, in the immediate aftermath of perceived loss we tend to experience emotional flooding. That means that our rational brain is not functioning at its greatest. That makes it difficult for us to tell ourselves that everything will be okay this is happening for me and not to me and that there is beautiful growth to be had. Instead we are likely to curse the situation or person , act out, question our worth, and make a strong case for life being against us. It is not until later that we are generally able to see the loss as a blessing. It is important to feel our feelings, but it is also important to assume the best: that even though we may not see it in this moment, we are gaining something. One of the most important assumptions in a relationship is assuming good intent assuming the best in our partner. This has a lot to do with the quality of our relationships but the reason I bring this up is that it is important to apply this with life. With the things that are going on around us. Assume good intent. Assume you are being looked after because if you assume you are not, you will be wrong most of the time. We are too focused on the negative instead of searching desperately for what is being gained. That should be the focus. If you assume ill intent you will always suffer more so take the opportunity to search search for the beauty search for the gain believe in the positive believe that you are being held hold faith and hope.

We seem to question whether it is okay to let people back in, or if we should just commit to when something is over it is over. There is not a one way fits all answer here. Second chances can be the most beautiful decision we have ever made. And saying hell no might be a response we never ever change or reconsider. I would like to offer two things to consider in helping decide what decision makes the most sense for you. When someone tries to re-enter your life, make sure you understand the growth they have achieved while they were away. If you are going to let someone back in, they should be able to clearly explain how they have grown, and what areas they know will be different they need awareness otherwise, it is likely that you will create the same patterns that led to that ending in the first place. Secondly, ask yourself what is driving your decision? For example, do you want to say yes because you have clearly understood their growth, or is it because you are tired of being alone? Make sure your motivating force is clean. And consider what it will be like if it ends for the second time. Can you be at peace with that? Is it okay for this person to re-enter and only take you a little bit further in your journey? Sometimes our answers are through trial and error, but if people want to re-enter without doing any work, it is likely a decision that will create the same outcome as before. Do not show up for mediocre love. Open yourself up to greater love. Sometimes that is from a former lover and sometimes that is someone else out there in this big, grand world.'},\n",

We so often think we know best. It is my life, so I am in charge. except sometimes it does not go according to our plan. Not because life is against us, but because there is something greater out there. Sometimes what is for us comes after what we perceive to be rejections or failures. Did not get the job? Could not make the relationship work? Easy to subscribe to being a failure easy to accept that maybe dating or marriage is not for us, or that we are just meant to be unhappy. I would like to challenge that thought. What we wanted 10 years ago, 5, 1, maybe months ago is different than what we may want now. That is good. We should be changing. We should be growing and learning new things about ourselves and the people we keep close. The problem is that we often see change as a negative. We should be accepted just as we are. No one should try to change us. ETC ETC. Seriously, it goes on and on but we need to shift that thinking. You DO have to change. You should not be okay with being the same person today as the person you will be in a year, or 5 or 10. Sometimes that means the people, the work, and the fun changes with you. Sometimes it stays the same because the people on your ride are growing with you but sometimes it is not them. Sometimes people grow at different speeds or different directions. That does not need to be a failure. Embrace your growth, embrace playing big and stepping into yourself. What does it mean to choose yourself every year. What stays the same, what changes, what gets challenged? You are not a failure. You are just on a road to searching for something greater. It is there. Step into it. Change. You are not a sculpture.

When we say things like if you do this, I will love you , or promise me you will never leave me , we actually wind up manipulating love. We send the message that we need to control certain things in order to feel safe and secure. It is backwards. That is not actually security. And unfortunately, it is not actually pure love. It is fear that takes over. It is fear that needs to control. And it is fear that keeps us from great love. So think about how love has presented itself in your life. Did you feel loved by your dad? Your mom? Your caretakers? Was fear there? Did love get withdrawn if you did something wrong? Did someone leave the family? Did it make you fear being abandoned? Is that why controlling love makes you feel safer? Please think about your story. Think about the meaning of love and what you do to protect yourself.

Questions like, you seem like you have it all together, why are you still single? Or, you are so beautiful, why have not you been able to find someone? These questions contain a very faulty message. Truth is, being single and happy is far greater than being in a relationship and unhappy. No matter how you slice it. Unhealthy relationships are not better than being alone especially when your alone is damn good. Sometimes people do not need saving sometimes people love their alone so much that they will only accept a relationship that enhances it. Sometimes it is not actually a pity party.

I spoke about this image at the Relationships 101 Event in Vancouver a few months ago and am always so deeply impacted when I see the image again and think of its meaning. There is a child inside all of us. A child who continues to reach out towards hope and healing. The child part of us that believes that security and safety is out there, even when we have not always experienced it. This is a reminder that no matter how much you might want to turn away, your light is always most ignited and hopeful when you turn towards. When you step into your vulnerability and surrender. I know life can get heavy at times. I know unhealed parts can get re-wounded over and over again and make us doubt in a life safer than this doubt in people who care. We see our patterns and find ourselves declaring this always happens. We carry all of our hurt with us year after year, and too often, do not do anything with it other than avoid and burry it. That contributes to an outer shell that has to protect itself by turning its back on everyone. That gets us nowhere. Pay attention to that child. Do not abandon yourself. Do not avoid yourself. Stop sending yourself the message that your story does not matter, and that your hurt and pain can not be healed. It can. But it takes your attention. It takes your commitment. It takes deliberate time to look inwardly and hold your inner child tight. Be the person you needed when you were younger.'},\n",

It is a lack of self awareness that keeps us from being greater greater friends, siblings, employees, bosses, partners etc. The lack of self awareness gives us permission to not do things differently. Read that again. The lack of self awareness gives us permission to stay the same. Because if we know better .we have to do better. Maya Angelou really got that one right. So when we avoid self awareness we are really sending ourselves and others the message that we are unwilling or just not ready to create change. How does that feel? What is getting in the way? What are the constraints? What fears are on the other side of your self awareness? You have to be ready to get real with yourself. To think about what is waiting to be understood and why we are not willing to go there. Change demands so much from us. It demands that we elevate ourselves. It demands that we elevate those around us. It demands that we look at our patterns and our wounds, and find ways to love the easily unlovable parts. It means that we have to stop saying this always happens to me , and it means that we have to believe in hope. Change exists, and we hold its reins but will fear yank them out of your hands, or will you take on the challenge of exploring yourself so that you can love yourself?

Maybe you are feeling less connected maybe things just do not feel the same anymore maybe she stays out after work a little bit longer, or he uses three words to answer how was your day? Maybe your sex life has changed, and priorities have shifted. Whatever it is when something feels off you need to pay attention to it. Something is shifting some dynamic is changing. Sometimes it is you and sometimes it is the other person, but what is most important is that a message is being sent without using words to communicate something. Too often we let the feeling sit and fester for way too long. We know something is up, but instead of voicing our concerns, we internalize what we are feeling and then act out in some way. When something feels off we need to learn to communicate that. We need to have the courage to speak up and and share. We need to ask questions. We need to make ourselves and the relationship a priority. We avoid instead of turning towards. Maybe we are afraid the other person will not listen maybe we expect them to dismiss and reject what it is we are saying but honoring ourselves enough to share ourselves is so valuable. There is always a message that is trying to be communicated. When something feels off, it is because we are not understanding that message. People do not always know how to put that message into words and therein lies the challenge. Look, we may not be perfect at it, but I encourage you to start somewhere. Try to put words to your message, before your behavior leads you down a road that is harder to come back from. When something feels off talk about it. Share your message or ask your partner about theirs. Create a safe environment where the priority is to understand.'},\n",

Whether you are in a relationship or single, today I ask you to do one loving thing for another person. It does not have to be romantic love .just the gifting of love to anyone around you. Buy a few flowers and hand them out to complete strangers. Hold the door and smile. Go volunteer at a soup kitchen. Buy a homeless person a meal the girl behind you coffee. Write a letter to a friend or your lover. Tell someone why you appreciate and love them. Make today more than money spent, or 24 hours of sadness. Use today to give and to receive, and to reflect on the love that is orbiting around you.

We convince ourselves that it is enough or that it is at least better than nothing. We shrink our needs and abandon ourselves by standing by and doing nothing about it. I can sit here and tell all of you that you are all enough that you are worthy of great love. That you belong and have the right to be understood. I can tell you all of these things, but so many of you will not absorb it. So many will hear it and dismiss it. Maybe you will stop reading right now. Maybe you will feel your defenses going up, doubt settling in, or internal declarations of well it is never happened before. And so instead of demanding that you accept that, what I will do instead is ask you to think about and explore what keeps you from believing it? What are your belief systems and narratives around love and relationships? What did you see and experience growing up, or in past intimate relationships, and how did that influence your self worth? Maybe a parent was unfaithful and destroyed your image of long lasting love. It was never spoken about and you saw them stay in an unfulfilling marriage. You took away a message that love does not last, or this is what love is maybe it is okay or expected to have low expectations and not need want more. Maybe you have been shamed for being single for too long you seem so great though I just do not understand?!? Perplexed family members, friends, and sometimes strangers do not realize that shaming being single can influence a decision to step into stay in an unheathy relationship. Something is better than nothing, right?! Or maybe you were the youngest in your family and every time you tried to share how you felt, you were overlooked and never heard. You are just the baby what do you know? And so, voicing fears and concerns or just simple requests and emotional needs feels off the table.

Let them have adventures in the wild without you Let them face their fears, let them crash and burn, let them rise up. And know, deep down, that heroes are not qualified by their capacity to stay but by their decision to return. Isa Garcia The way a person leaves reveals so much. Yes, we know on some level they have to and maybe even that it is the right thing but the way in which they do it reflects their level of functioning. Does the person communicate clearly, do they shut down and just disappear, do they place all the blame on you, are they stepping into something new that elevates them, or going back to something that keeps them playing small? Are they inconsiderate, disrespectful, mean, shut down, or defensive, or are they kind, calm, honest, and willing to take ownership for where they are right now? We can not keep a person from leaving that is not our job, but we can learn a lot about a person by the way in which they do it and similarly we can learn a lot about ourselves. Most people prefer clear closure. People have a yearning to understand. We want to make sense of things. We believe that if we can understand, then we can be released. Unfortunately, some people leave and they do not or can not give us the clarity we seek. They do not provide answers. They do not help us understand. What I say to that? We have all of the answers we seek from others within us. We have all of the closure we could ever need if we just allow ourselves to go there if we are willing to admit what it is we have been denying or convincing ourselves out of.
